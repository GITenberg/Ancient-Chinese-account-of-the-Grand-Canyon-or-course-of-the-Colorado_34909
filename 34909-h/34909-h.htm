<h2>TEN SUNS IN THE SKY!</h2>

<p>The ancient Chinese records tell of a "Place of Ten Suns," where "Ten
Suns rose and shone together" (see Appendix, note 1).</p>

<p>Seven Suns were also seen shining together in the sky! and at night (if indeed
we can call it "night") as many as seven moons! (What a haunt for lovers
and poets!)</p>

<p>Five Suns were also beheld (see note 2).</p>

<p>What Liars those Chinese writers are!</p>

</div>

<p>Very good; but why not denounce all our own
Arctic navigators as a pack of Liars? They all tell about more Suns than
one! A picture of Five (see Figure 1) is furnished by a most eminent explorer
(note 3). The dictionaries and cyclopedias of our careful publishers call the
appearance of two or more suns (or moons) a <b>Parhelion</b>. The number of the
multiplied "luminaries" never exceeds Ten (note 4). There actually is a "Place
of Ten Suns."</p>

<p>Ten Suns say the Ancients.</p>

<p>Ten Suns say the Moderns.</p>

<h2>AMERICA SHAPED LIKE A TREE.</h2>

<p>The ancient Mexicans likened North America to a Tree&mdash;a stupendous
<b>Mulberry Tree</b>&mdash;"planted in the land known to us today as South America"
(n. 5).</p>

<p>The Chinese geographers or mythologists teach that at a distance of 30,000
<b>le</b> (10,000 miles) to the east there is a land 10,000 <b>le</b> (over 3,000) miles in width.</p>

<p>Now the land referred to must be North America, for, 10,000 miles east
from southern China brings us to California; and we further find that North
America, now reached, is 10,000 <b>le</b>, or over 3,000 miles in width, measuring
from the Pacific to the Atlantic.</p>

<p>The Chinese accounts further call our eastern realm a <b>Fu-Sang</b> (or Helpful
<b>Mulberry</b>) land.</p>

<p>A <b>Mulberry</b> land (3,000 miles wide) is <b>There</b>, say the Chinese.</p>

<p>The <b>Mulberry</b> land (3,000 miles wide) is <b>Here</b>, say the Mexicans.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like the Mexicans, the Chinese sages declare that there is an enormous
Tree&mdash;the <b>Fu</b> (or helpful) <b>Sang</b> Tree&mdash;in the eastern Mulberry land 3,000
miles wide.</p>

<p>As just remarked, the Chinese call the enormous Eastern Tree a <b>Sang</b>,
and the Mexicans call their enormous Tree a <b>Beb</b> (both terms standing for the
<b>Mulberry</b>,&mdash;a fact to which no writer hitherto has directed, or called, attention.)</p>

<p>Observe (see Figure 2) that at Tehauntepec (a little west of Yucatan) our
continent narrows down to a width of 100 miles (or 300 Chinese <b>le</b>).</p>

<p>The Mexicans say that North America is a Tree, and that it has a correspondingly
enormous Trunk,&mdash;which at Tehauntepec measures 100 miles (or
300 Chinese <b>le</b>).</p>

<p>Now the Chinese writers declare that the enormous Mulberry in the region
east of the Flowery Kingdom has "a Trunk of 300 <b>le</b>" (or 100 miles.) What a
prodigious dimension! (see note 6.)</p>

<p>A Mulberry Tree, with a "Trunk of 300 <b>le</b>," is <b>There</b>, say the Chinese.</p>

<p>A Mulberry Tree, with a Trunk of 300 <b>le</b>, is <b>Here</b>, say the Mexicans.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Such a stupendous Tree ought to have enormous Branches to match the
Trunk, and we are not surprised when informed that our monarch of the forest
goes up&mdash;up&mdash;up even to the Place of the 10 Suns (in the Arctic zone.)</p>

<p>The One true sun is, of course, high above the mountain ranges, or
"Branches" of our Continental Mulberry.</p>

<p>But the extra Nine are false or delusive and mere reflections of the true
sun on fog or vapor. The Chinese account, truly enough, states that they bear
<b>wu</b>, and this term stands for "blackness," "inky," or "dark" (Williams dict. p.
1058.)</p>

<p>This identical term <b>wu</b> also stands for black or dark <b>fowls</b>, such as the
raven, blackbird, and crow; and one Oriental scholar, dwelling indeed in Japan,
assures us that each of the Nine Suns bears a <b>Crow</b>! We are seriously informed,
that "all bear&mdash;literally cause to ride&mdash;a <b>Crow</b>" (note 7.)</p>

<p>As well might it be asserted that because <b>wu</b> signifies "black," the Nine
<b>Wu</b> borne by the Suns must be nine blacks or negroes! The supposition that<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 3]</span>
Nine <b>Crows</b> are meant is absurd and contradicted by the luminaries themselves.</p>

<span class="caption">Figure 2. Our Continental American Tree.</span>
</div>

<p>Strange to say, the "luminaries" emit no radiance! The light that is in
them is darkness, and they are fitting symbols for commentators&mdash;black, white,
yellow, and green&mdash;who have written learnedly and positively on them without
understanding a thing about them. Perhaps it might be well, apart from
its inconvenience, when writing about any nation, place, or natural object, to
ascertain the position and name of the <b>continent</b> in which the subject of study
is situated. Of course we are not so unreasonable as to insist that we must
really comprehend a matter before getting up to explain it to others, but the
positions of continents dealt with ought, as a rule, to be clearly ascertained. In
the present instance we have faithfully followed the ancient directions and
groped our way into the presence of the Nine blind suns. Gazing at their
beaming disks we perceive how the term wu (black or dark) applies to them.
The <b>color</b> of Crows is there, but not the living birds themselves. It is the
story of the Three Black Crows advanced another stage on its career of misrepresentation,
and magnified Threefold. The Nine Suns have neither swallowed
nor disgorged Nine Black Crows. But they are certainly open to the charge of
having feasted too freely on diet no less dark and deceptive.</p>


<p>They're the <b>color</b> of Crows, say the Ancients.</p>

<p>They <b>bear</b> Nine Crows, say the Moderns.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>The truth is that the false suns furnish neither heat nor light and really
consist of dark (<b>wu</b>) vapor.</p>

<p>The Nine are mere reflections of the low-declined, true sun on "surrounding"
frozen haze or mist, in extremely cold weather. When this icy fog seems&mdash;merely
seems, of course,&mdash;to touch and surround the true sun, the illusions
known as false suns are apt to appear. They obey some optical code of laws
or signals understood best perhaps by themselves, and will sometimes disappear
in a moment like a flock of timid "sun birds" (or wild geese&mdash;see note 8.)
Their design apparently is to cheer and escort their illustrious sire in his otherwise
lonesome trip through a frozen, desolate zone. Some Chinese accounts
call them "children"&mdash;"children of the sun," etc., etc.</p>

<p>There is a reference to this frozen mist, in Verne's "Fur Country," reading
as follows: "It is not a mist or fog,' he said to his companions, 'it is frost-rime,'
a dense vapor which remains in a state of complete congelation. But whether
a fog or a frozen mist, this phenomenon was none the less to be regretted for it
rose a hundred feet at least above the level of the sea, and it was so opaque
that the colonists could not see each other when only two or three paces
apart."&mdash;Danvers' translation, p. 288.</p>

<p>It should be remarked that the frozen haze which breeds the false suns is
found only "at the bottom of," or "below," the mountain ranges or "branches"
of our North American Mulberry Tree. The false suns speedily disappear
from the view of the observer who climbs up out of the thick stratum of frozen
fog or mist and ascends the nearest "Branch."</p>

<p>Such observations are completely in accord with the ancient Chinese
declaration that Nine of the suns are to be seen "below" (<b>hia</b>) or "at the bottom
of" the Branches, and One "above" the Branches. The suns (see note 9)
are not said to be "in the Branches." Nine are "below" (<b>hia</b>) and One
"above" (<b>shang</b>); a remark as true today as it ever was.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The "Morea" (about fifty miles long), in Greece, was so named because it
was supposed to resemble the leaf of a <b>morus</b> or mulberry. And similarly
North America was considered by Mexican and Chinese mythologists to exhibit
some resemblance to a mulberry,&mdash;the Helpful Mulberry (or <b>Fu-Sang</b>). The
one comparison is just as fanciful or reasonable as the other. Nor can it be
denied that North America presents some likeness to a Tree,&mdash;towering aloft
like the Tree of the Prophet Daniel, which was seen from the ends of the
earth. Here Columbia lights up her Tree and welcomes the Neighbors with
a smile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Chinese note concerning the extra suns and moons, which frequently
flit about and disappear, like so many sun-birds, connects them with the
"Branches" of the Fu (or Fu-Sang) Tree of amazing proportions, which flourishes
in the Region east of the Eastern Sea. The Fu-Sang land, 10,000 <b>le</b> (or
3,000 miles wide) is said to be 30,000 <b>le</b> (10,000 miles) to the east of China;
and this indeed is the distance from Canton to California. A lesser distance
(20,000 <b>le</b>, or 7,000 miles) lies between Northern China and the American
Mulberry land due east. It is in America that we are directed to search for the
surplus assemblage of suns. And do we not find both them and Fu-Sang?<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 5]</span>
(See note 10.) In what respect is the Chinese account inaccurate thus far?
We are informed that "in the water is a large tree having nine suns," etc. The
Trunk of this prodigious Tree, which is more or less immersed in the Eastern
Sea, furnishes the surprising dimension of "300 <b>le</b>." And rising above a Valley
of Hot Springs (readily found in Nicaragua) the Tree proceeds upward and
rears aloft its exalted Branches in the "Place of the Ten Suns."</p>

<p>The vast mountain-system, with its tree-like "Trunk" and "Branches," on
which the many suns and moons are seen to alight or gambol, is called the
"Sun and Moon <b>shan</b>" (<b>shan</b> signifying "mountain or range") in both the
Chinese text and the translation (see note 11.) It is identical with our continental
stony Mulberry and constitutes the form of North America. Unfortunately
our esteemed translator was utterly in the dark concerning the sense of the
curious statements regarding the manifold suns and moons and even suggested
that an explanation should be sought for in connection with the Philippine
Islands. But the Tree, or range of the Sun and Moon, is plainly in North
America. And here are the flocks of Suns roosting among the Branches.</p>


<h2>NOTICE OF OUR GRAND CANYON.</h2>

<p>According to the translation, a "Great Canyon" is to be seen in the "Great
Eastern Waste" "Beyond the Eastern Sea." And this Great Canyon is placed
in connection with the "Sun and Moon <b>shan</b>",&mdash;which possesses the Mulberry's
Branches and exhibit of Suns already glanced at (note 12.)</p>

<p>We read that a stream flows through this canyon, "producing a charming
gulf." We are further informed that "the water accumulates and so forms a
gulf." A river flowing through the "Great Canyon," swells or widens out,
displays a broadening expanse of water and becomes a Gulf, a "Charming
Gulf."</p>

<p>Is not this the beautiful Gulf of California, which is a widening out or
enlargement of a notable stream, the Colorado? Decidedly this mighty and
famous river, whose "water accumulates and so forms a gulf," flows through
a Canyon. Moreover, this Canyon is truly a "Great Canyon." It is the greatest
and grandest on the planet. It is also found in the "Great Waste to the east of
the Eastern Sea," which washes the coast of China. It is the Grand Canyon of
the Colorado.</p>

<p>The translation informs us (note 13) that this stream which flows into, or
becomes a gulf has a "delightful spring." The Canyon "has a beautiful mountain,
from which there flows a delightful spring, producing a charming gulf.
The water accumulates and so forms a gulf." Such is the translation; but no
Chinese term for "spring" appears in the text. The original states that it is a
<b>kan shui</b> which runs through the Canyon, and this identical compound is
translated "Sweet River" by our author on page 163 of his large and comprehensive
work. <b>Kan</b> indeed signifies sweet, sweetness; delightsome, pleasant,
happy, refreshing; and <b>Shui</b> stands for "water or river" (see Williams dict. pp.
310, 781.) It is therefore evident that a <b>kan shui</b> should be remarkable for
the sweetness of its water and should start from a "delightful spring" of <b>sweet</b>
water, in order to be pure and deserve its reputation.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 6]</span></p>

<p>As a geographical fact, the Colorado flows out of the very fount which
curiously enough, gives birth to the "Sweet Water." This stream becomes the
Platte or Nebraska river, which joins the Missouri. And from the fount of the
Sweet Water, exactly on the mountain divide, a head-stream of the Colorado
bubbles out, enlarging into the affluent known as the "Green," the stream
traverses the Grand Canyon and connects with the Gulf. (note 14.)</p>

<p>It should have a spring of <b>kan shui</b> or <b>sweet water</b>; and we find that it
comes sparkling down the mountains from a <b>Sweet Water</b> spring.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Sweet Water stream after traversing a Canyon, even a "Great Canyon"
should connect with, or enlarge into, a gulf, described as "charming." Can the
Gulf of California be regarded as charming?</p>

<p>One explorer expresses himself as charmed and delighted with the scenery
of the gulf. A sample passage in his report reads as follows: "The island and
mountain peaks, whose outlines, as seen from the gulf, had been somewhat
dimmed by a light haze, appeared surprisingly near and distinct in the limpid
medium through which they were now viewed. The whole panorama became
invested with new attractions, and it would be hard to say whether the dazzling
radiance of the day or the sparkling clearness of the night was the more
beautiful and brilliant. (note 15.)</p>

<p>Truly a charming and beautiful Gulf is here.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although the translation does not draw attention to the fact, the term employed
in the Chinese record to describe the course of the stream which passes
through the Great Canyon, is <b>chu</b>. Now this word is employed to designate
water which is "shooting over a ledge" (Williams' dict. p. 89), and its use is
entirely appropriate in a description of the course of the water in the channel
of the Colorado. The bed of the stream is exceedingly irregular and consists
indeed of a succession of <b>ledges</b>&mdash;producing a series of rapids, falls, or cataracts.
Were the water to disappear, the exposed bed of the Colorado, with its
ascending series of steps, might be likened indeed with truth to a stairway for
giants or gods.</p>

<p>The falls caused by <b>ledges</b> (<b>chu</b>) are exceedingly numerous. One navigator's
log contains many such entries as the following: "Still more rapids and
falls today. In one, the Emma Dean [a boat] is caught in a whirlpool, and set
spinning about (n. 16).</p>

<p>One subdivision of the Grand Canyon is known as Cataract Canyon, and
this section "in its 41 miles, has 75 rapids and cataracts, and 57 of these are
crowded into 19 miles, with falls, in places, of 16 to 20 feet" (n. 17.)</p>

<p>All accounts concur in representing the stream as remarkable for the fury
and number of its falls. To ascend the Colorado is a sheer impossibility and
even to descend the stream is an enterprise rarely indeed attempted or
achieved. Only rafts or life-boats, backed by pluck and luck, stand a chance
of getting through&mdash;in pieces. The mariners all wear life-belts and are just as
often in the water as they are out of it. Evidently a River of <b>Ledges</b> is here.
Surely the term <b>Chu</b> (or water shooting over <b>Ledges</b>) applies with peculiar
force to the career of this "wildest of rivers"&mdash;the Colorado.</p>


<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 7]</span></p>
<h2>THE COLORADO&mdash;BOTTOMLESS?</h2>


<p>Knowing quite well as we do, that our mighty river possesses a very
substantial bottom composed of step-like ledges of rock, we learn with surprise
that it is said to flow through a section described as <b>bottomless</b>! Is not such
a statement or assertion absurd? But what did the ancient writer mean? What
could he have meant?</p>

<p>The translation states that, according to a poem, the <b>Tsang-shan-wu</b>, "in
the east there is a stream flowing in a <b>bottomless</b> ravine. It is supposed to
be this Canyon"&mdash;the "Great Canyon of the Region beyond the Eastern Sea."</p>

<p>The Chinese term rendered "Canyon" is <b>Hoh</b>, which stands also for "a bed
of a torrent, a deep gully or wady; a valley" (see Williams dict. p. 453.)</p>

<p>Of course, a <b>Ta</b> (or "Great") <b>Hoh</b> ought to be a Great Canyon, or a
remarkable deep gorge or valley containing the bed of a torrent.</p>

<p>We have already been informed that a <b>Chu</b> (or river of ledges and falls) is
in the <b>Ta Hoh</b>, or mighty gorge beyond the Eastern Sea. We also perceive
that the title <b>Ta Hoh</b> applies properly to the mountain-hemmed course of our
Colorado (which connects with Middle Park and runs to the Gulf.)</p>

<p>Somewhere in this immense and peerless <b>Ta Hoh</b>&mdash;somewhere among the
majestic mountains&mdash;somewhere along the bed of the Colorado (either inside
or outside of Middle Park,) the investigator should find a section which is
<b>bottomless</b>. The ancient account locates it there. Nor are we to look for it
in any Philippine Island. We are restricted to the bed or banks of the Colorado
which we have identified as the <b>Chu</b> or plunging river that rushes downward
to the Gulf. Our leaping stream flows into and out of Grand Lake (within
Middle Park.) Now this Lake (or enlargement of the bed of the Grand
Colorado) "has a beach, and far out into the body of the water a sandy bottom"
and "in the center, covering an area of nearly a <b>mile</b> square the Lake to all
appearance is <b>bottomless</b>."</p>

<p>We are further informed that "explorations of the edges of this great submarine
cavern give the most positive evidences that it was once the crater of a
great volcano" (note 18).</p>

<p>"The Lake to all appearance is bottomless. The deepest soundings that
could ever be made have failed to reach bottom. Hence it is concluded that it
has <b>no bottom</b>."</p>

<p>Turn these two words, "no bottom" into Chinese and we get <b>wu ti</b>,&mdash;the
very terms employed in the Chinese account.</p>

<p>No bottom, say the Ancients.</p>

<p>No bottom, say the Moderns.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The old account puts the unfathomable abyss in a <b>Kuh</b> (valley or ravine)
and it is within a Valley&mdash;the Valley of Middle Park&mdash;that we actually find it.
Moreover, this bottomless valley is "supposed" (or reported) to belong to the
<b>Ta Hoh</b>&mdash;a title which would cover both Valley and Canyon. Indeed, Middle
Park, with its enormous mountain-walls connects directly with the system of
the Grand Canyon. Moreover, the one stream flows through both. And here
it may be remarked that the <b>Chu</b> (or River of Ledges and Falls) is not termi<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 8]</span>nated
or swallowed up by the Bottomless abyss in <b>Kuh</b> (or Valley of Middle
Park.) It flows on through the <b>Ta Hoh</b> and ultimately enlarges into a Gulf
(the Gulf of California).</p>

<p>The rocky floor of the <b>Kuh</b> (or Valley of Middle Park) evidently constitutes
a support or bottom for an impetuous and important River of Ledges or
rapids and yet, at the same time, is reported to be Bottomless. This seems
contradictory. But reaching the precise locality referred to in the old account,
modern scientists simply echo the declaration of the Ancients,&mdash;that this Valley
or <b>Kuh</b>, traversed by a leaping, furious <b>Chu</b>, is unfathomable.</p>

<p>Bottomless! say the Ancients.</p>

<p>Bottomless! say the Moderns.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It thus appears that a statement seemingly calculated at first sight to drown
the ancient claim in a flood of derision, turns out on examination to be overwhelmingly
powerful evidence in support of the validity of the old record.</p>

<p>In no respect or degree is the ancient testimony contradicted or falsified by
modern evidence. Take for instance the old assertion that the <b>shan</b> or mountain-range
of the Great Canyon, is "beautiful." Nothing seems more natural
than to conclude that such a laudatory term is grossly out of place and that the
Mountain-range, with its Canyon and furious <b>Chu</b>, is a frightful, gloomy, dangerous,
horrible, repulsive, bleak, and ugly mass of shattered and tottering
heights. And, indeed, there is much truth in this view of the situation. Nevertheless,
modern visitors unite in declaring that Beauty is a marked feature of
the rocky heights that possess or direct the Colorado; and this is in agreement
with the ancient account.</p>

<p>One traveler says: "The roar of its waters was heard unceasingly, ... but
its walls and cliffs, its peaks and crags, its amphitheatres and alcoves, tell a
story of <b>beauty</b> and sublimity" (note 19).</p>

<p>Another visitor, who was treated most disrespectfully by our <b>Chu</b>, has
eyes only for its "beauty": "The Canyon grows more and more picturesque and
<b>beautiful</b> the farther we proceed.... On many of the long stretches where
the river can be seen for several miles, the picture is one of charming <b>beauty</b>....
As the clouds rose we were treated to scenes rare and <b>beautiful</b> in the
extreme" (n. 20.)</p>

<p>Again: "Cataract and Narrow Canyons are wonderful, Glen Canyon is
<b>beautiful</b>, Marble Canyon is mighty; but it is left for the Grand Canyon,
where the river has cut its way down through the sandstones, the marbles, and
the granites of the Kaibab Mountains, to form those <b>beautiful</b> and awe-inspiring
pictures that are seen from the bottom of the black granite gorge, where
above us rise great wondrous mountains of bright red sandstone capped with
cathedral domes and spires of white, with pinnacles and turrets, and towers, in
such intricate forms and flaming colors that words fail to convey any idea of
their <b>beauty</b> and sublimity."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The translation informs us that the mighty gorge is the Canyon of <b>Kiang</b>,
<b>Shang</b>, or Almighty God.</p>

<p>And a modern visitor declares that "here Omnipotence stands revealed,"
and that here is "a glorious creation of God." (n. 21.)<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>So impressed were the ancients with the beauty and grandeur of this
region that they peopled it with the souls of illustrious sages, and declared that
here was the Canyon of Almighty God. And those who enter it today, come
reeling back from its portals,&mdash;declaring that no mortal can describe its glories,
and that it is the Grand Canyon of Almighty God!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Words fail one in the attempt to describe this glorious creation of God.
The impression it leaves upon the mind is overpowering. One feels as though
he had been admitted into the presence of the Genii of the plutonic regions,
had penetrated to the very heart of the inner world of elemental creations."</p>

<p>We need not wonder that the old account connects a revered ancestor with
this glorious and celestial retreat in the Grand Canyon. He is called <b>Shao
Hao</b>, and is furthur termed a <b>ju</b>, (or sucking child.)</p>

<p><b>Shao</b> signifies "little" or "a little," and <b>Hao</b> is formed of the signs for
"sun" and "heaven." It is therefore evident that the <b>ju</b> or infant at the Canyon
is (or was) a little sun child, or child of the sun.</p>

<p>American rulers called themselves "Children of the Sun," and we should
be careful not to confound our Arizona Prince with any Asiatic ruler. [The
<b>Hao</b> or <b>Shao Hao</b> of supposed Chinese origin is represented by some different
symbols: see Williams' dict. p. 172, columns 1 and 2.]</p>

<p>The little Child of the Sun at the <b>Ta-Hoh</b> or Great Canyon should not be&mdash;must
not be&mdash;confounded with any early Chinese sun-worshiper. We are to
look <b>far to the east of China</b> for both the Canyon and the little Child of the
Sun referred to in the account before us.</p>

<p>We are informed that the country connected with the Great Canyon was
called "<b>Shao Hao's</b> country" (or the land of the Sun-child) on account of the
little Prince. He entered (<b>chi</b>) it, and this furnished the <b>reason</b> (or <b>chih</b>) for
its title&mdash;Land of the Sun-child.</p>

<p>The infant (or <b>ju</b>) is distinctly called a ruler (or <b>ti</b>.) Moreover, although
he was little (<b>shao</b>) or but a <b>ju</b> (suckling); he was a supreme king (or <b>chwen
suh</b>). (Note 22.)</p>

<p><b>Chwen</b> is formed by putting together the two words "only" and "head."
And <b>suh</b> is a Chinese term composed of the two significant words "only" and
"king" (see Williams' dict. pp. 117, 825, 1043.)</p>

<p>Evidently the baby ruler (or <b>ju ti</b>) was regarded by his people, in this
region remarkable for its mountains, as the only or supreme head&mdash;the <b>chwen
suh</b>, as Chinese historians might forcibly phrase it&mdash;of the people ruled.</p>

<p>[Because the infant was king and even the supreme king, it seems reasonable
to suppose that his father was dead (and his mother alive) at the time
when he was carried into the Great Canyon and duly suckled there.] We need
not just here attempt to unravel his history. Enough to show that our Grand
Canyon is positively and clearly referred to in Chinese literature. We may,
however, note the fact that the royal infant (see translation) belonged to the
<b>Kin Tien</b> or Golden Heaven family, and this title must be considered when
the history of our Arizona Prince comes to be investigated. It should further
be remarked that the respected translator has erred slightly in his supposition
that the <b>Chwen Suh</b> (or Supreme Head) was "Shao <b>Hao's descendant</b>."<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 10]</span>
The Chinese terms in the original are: <b>shao hao</b> (not <b>hao's</b>) <b>ju</b> (baby) <b>ti</b>
(ruler) <b>chwen suh</b> (head king.) It was the <b>little sun child ruler and
supreme king</b> who was at the Canyon.</p>

<p>Particular attention should be paid to the fact, that, although regarded as
a supreme ruler, the Prince is represented as being but a suckling (or <b>ju</b>)
when in the neighborhood of the Great Canyon.</p>

<p>Now, the translation states that this baby or supreme lord "of whom no
further description is given, <b>left there his lute</b> and lyre. It says that <b>his lute</b>
and lyre are in this canyon."</p>


<h2>MUSIC IN THE GRAND CANYON?</h2>

<p>It is absurd to imagine for a moment that a <b>sucking</b> infant could own, or
could be really supposed to own, a <b>lute</b>. The Chinese text does not say that
the musical instrument is "his." And yet, curiously enough, it does declare
that the baby-prince left or abandoned (<b>k'i</b>) a Lute or Lyre in the Canyon.</p>

<p>Why should such a matter be mentioned? Supposing that a fiddle was
left behind, or a drum, or a rattle, why should the trivial fact be gravely
recorded?</p>

<p>If a Lute was left in the mighty chasm, its remains might be there still.
But how could an infant be said to leave or abandon a Lute? Would he not
try, so well as our memory serves, to first get it into his mouth? Would not
his chubby hands, quite stout enough for destructive arts, tear the strings
apart and feed the music to the nearest cat? Would it be a lute at all when
ultimately relinquished? And if the babe derived pleasure from ill-treated
and squalling strings, why should he leave the lute behind? As well say that
the suckling abandoned there a fishing-rod! Would not a milk-bottle be a
much readier fount of ecstacy than either a lute or a flute? Why, neither one
nor the other <b>could be heard</b> within the Canyon.</p>

<p>A Chinese commentator, however, relieves us from the necessity of seeking
for a literal lute between the resounding jaws of the mighty chasm (note 23.)
He says it is erroneous (<b>ngo</b>) to suppose that the baby emperor (<b>ju ti</b>) grasped
(<b>ping</b>,) or left behind (<b>chi</b>) or abandoned in the place of midnight darkness
(<b>huen</b>) any lutes or lyres (<b>kin seh</b>.) In hyperbolical language (<b>wu wu</b>)&mdash;which
is never true when taken literally&mdash;a clear limpid river (<b>shuh</b>) would
be the lute (<b>kin</b>.)</p>

<p>But how could a clear stream serve as a lute?</p>

<p>The running water might produce limpid notes. Thus Moore, in his ode
on "Harmony," uses the following words:</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"Listen!&mdash;when the night-wind dies</span><br />
Down the still current, <b>like a harp</b> it sighs!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A liquid <b>chord</b> in every wave that flows."</span><br />
</p></div>

<p>Here is a current of water likened to the string of a harp, and the playing
of winds compared to music.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sigourney calls Niagara a "Trump," and we accept the assertion
(although literally it is quite untrue.)<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 11]</span></p>

<p>But if the Chinese account placed a Trump in the Ontario chasm there
would be considerable difficulty in finding it.</p>

<p>Fortunately, in the case immediately before us, it is a Chinese author who
tells us that we are to seek for limpid streams rather than for literal lutes or
lyres.</p>

<p>The mention of the latter would probably imply that the sounds of some
stream or streams in the Great Canyon are of a remarkably soft and musical
character.</p>

<p>Streams may produce delightful tones. Thus one observer (at Yellowstone)
tells of the "mysterious music of the distant falls" "like the tremulous vibration
of a mighty but remote harp-string." (note 24)</p>

<p>If falling water under certain peculiar acoustic circumstances can produce
notes like those struck off from harp-strings, the tones can also be compared
to those of lutes or lyres (for all are stringed instruments.)</p>

<p>The very volume which places lutes and lyres in the Great Canyon, also
tells of a forest elsewhere, which is a "Forest of Lutes and Lyres" (note 25.)</p>

<p>Of course sounds merely resembling those of the stringed instruments, are
here referred to. A forest is composed of trees rather than musical instruments,
but it may produce musical tones like those of Lutes and Lyres.</p>

<p>And similarly the notes arising from the Grand Canyon may be of a lute-like
character. This is the teaching of the Ancients. We have found the Bottomless
stream and it is certain that visitors should return with accounts of
melody arising from the Canyon. Future explorers should listen for musical
notes. They will certainly not be disappointed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One visitor says: "The waters waltz their way through the Canyon, making
their own rippling, rushing, roaring music." We further read of innumerable
cascades adding their wild music to the roar of the river."</p>

<p>What are these innumerable cascades but the strings of the Lute which
was heard ages ago by enraptured ears and which has kept on resounding
ever since. The concert in the Canyon drowns even the basic roar of the
river. The music is there.</p>

<p>"We sit on some overhanging rocks, and enjoy the scene for a time, listening
to the music of falling waters away up the canyons." (n. 26.)</p>

<p>It appears that the acoustic properties of the Grand Canyon are calculated
to produce most notable effects: "Great hollow domes are seen in the eastern
side of the rock.... Our words are repeated with startling clearness, but in
a soft mellow tone, that transforms them into magical music."</p>

<p>Elsewhere an immense grotto "was doubtless made for an academy of
<b>music</b> by its storm born architect; so we name it <b>Music</b> Temple." (n. 27.)</p>

<p>Lutes and Lyres are there, say the Ancients.</p>

<p>A Temple of Music is there, say the Moderns.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the Chinese annotater calls the Great Canyon&mdash;the
<b>Ta Hoh</b>&mdash;a place of (<b>huen</b>) midnight darkness and declares that it is erroneous
to suppose that the Lute played down there (where it could not possibly
be heard) was an instrument held by a human hand (the hand of a suckling!).<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 12]</span>
Now, although the great gorge is wonderfully beautiful, it must be conceded
that its basic part (within which human beings might dwell) is decidedly dark.
Here "it is necessary to 'lie down upon one's back in order to see the sky,'&mdash;as
I once heard General Crook express it. Into much of this deep gorge no ray
of sunshine ever falls, and it well deserves the name of the 'Dark Canyon.'"
(n. 28). Often in midday, stars are seen shining overhead; and it may well be
called a place of midnight darkness (<b>huen</b>.)</p>

<p>In the following passage a modern visitor notices the "dark and frowning"
walls of the chasm, but still enlarges on their beauty:&mdash;"One would think that
after traveling through six hundred miles of those canyons, one would be satisfied
with <b>beauty</b> and grandeur, but in this fact lies the charm. Of the six
hundred miles no two miles are alike. The picture is ever changing from
grandeur to beauty, from beauty to sublimity, from the <b>dark</b> and <b>frowning</b>
greatness of its granite walls, to the dazzling colors of its upper cliffs. And I
stood in the last few miles of the Grand Canyon spellbound in wonder and
admiration, as firmly as I was fixed in the first few miles in surprise and astonishment."
(note 29.)</p>

<p>Nature has done her best to adorn the walls of the mighty gorge. We are
told of "<b>thousands of rivulets</b>" that "dropped farther and farther down, till
the whole of the bright scarlet walls seemed hung with a tapestry of silver
threads, the border fringed with white fleecy clouds which hung to the tops of
the walls, and through which the points of the upper cliffs shone as scarlet
tassels."</p>

<p>Nor was Dame Nature completely satisfied with her tapestry and fringe of
tassels. Other embroidery was displayed. "As the sun broke through some
side gorge, the canyon was spanned from side to side, as the clouds shifted
their position, with rainbow after rainbow, vying to outdo in brilliancy of color
the walls of the canyon themselves."</p>

<p>The ancient account declares, that in "the Region beyond the Eastern
Sea," a Bottomless river traverses a Great Canyon. And this stream, remarkable
for its ledges (<b>chu</b>) or rapids and falls, rushes onward and downward,
and grows or enlarges into a Gulf. And the Canyon, the River, and the Gulf
are all reported to be <b>Kan</b>&mdash;or <b>Beautiful</b>.</p>

<p>And visitors today return from all three, declaring that they are Beautiful!
Beautiful!! Beautiful!!!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And some are entranced by strains of music arising from the mouth of the
Canyon and declare that it holds an "orchestra." In one place the thousands
of streamlets, glistening and gleaming like silvery cords, stretch downward from
the edge of the painted chasm; and the resounding, melodious precipice is called
"the Cliff of the Harp." (note 30.) What is this but an echo of the ancient
declaration that the royal Lute in the Canyon was merely a musical stream.
Similar ideas have occurred to poets. Coleridge in his "Ancient Mariner,"
tells of</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p>
"A noise like of a hidden brook<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">In the leafy month of June,</span><br />
Which to the sleeping woods all night<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Singeth a quiet tune."</span><br />
</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 13]</span></p>
<p>And Moore has heard the notes of harp-strings sounding forth from melodious
streams. What wonder, then, that ancient poets (and the translation
states that the particular work which makes mention of the "Bottomless <b>Kuh</b>"
or valley, is a "poem") should have likened a collection of falling streams or
cascades to the chords of a tuneful Lute and then, to distinguish it from others
less excellent, have applied to the stringed instrument the name of their Prince.
Americans today gravely talk of visiting or seeing "St. Luke's Head" (in California!)
And we possess a mere natural formation which is supposed to
resemble a nose and is religiously called "St. Anthony's Nose." In truth this
"nose" is no more a literal nose than the "Lute" in the Canyon is a literal
stringed instrument made by men. Then we have "Cleopatra's Bath" and
"Pompey's Pillar." (Next tell us in the interest of chaos and confusion that
Pompey left here "his" Pillar.)</p>

<p>In the grand caves at Pikes Peak there is an "organ," which is really no
organ at all. It is a natural formation or production from which charming
melodies are fetched by skilled musicians. Now if we ourselves can gravely
call a musical, highly-strung rock an "Organ," may not the Ancients be excused
for calling a combination of musical streams a Lute? Contemplating the "Cliff
of the Harp," we can readily understand how old-time visitors found down
there the tuneful string of a "Lute" and how an imperial Child of the Sun was
unable to lug along "his" notable musical toy. There it remains and melodious
notes still come floating up.</p>

<p>Lutes and Lyres are there, say the Ancients.</p>

<p>"An Academy of Music!" say the Moderns.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Chinese annotater remarks that the <b>lieh tsze</b> (a class of sages or
teachers&mdash;the literati) are unacquainted (<b>pu chi</b>) with the <b>sheu-hai</b> or Gulf
situated toward the east (<b>chi tung</b>.)</p>

<p>The Chinese scholars of the writer's time knew little or nothing of our
Gulf of California (or <b>Sheu-hai</b>). However, it was known to some; and we
are now informed that it is <b>ki</b> (a <b>few</b>; nearly about, approximately) <b>yih</b> (to
<b>guess</b>, to bet; 100,000; an indeterminate number) <b>wan</b> (10,000) <b>le</b>.</p>

<p>A single <b>wan le</b> should measure about 3,000 miles, and a <b>few</b> (to "guess")
separate China from the <b>Ta-Hoh</b> which connects with the Bottomless <b>kuh</b> or
valley ("<b>Ta-Hoh shih wei wu ti chi kuh</b>.)</p>

<p>Evidently the Great Canyon lies more than <b>one wan le</b> (3,000 miles) to the
east of China. We find indeed that the number may well be referred to as "a
few" (<b>ki</b>.)</p>

<p>Nor can the Gulf be <b>more</b> than about 30,000 <b>le</b> to the east, seeing that
this Gulf of California is in "the region beyond the Eastern Sea" along with the
<b>Fu-Tree</b> which has a trunk of 300 <b>le</b>. The Gulf to the east is connected with
the mountain system whose Branches exhibit the gorgeous spectacle of Ten
Suns. In short, the Gulf and Canyon are along with <b>Fu-Sang</b>; and <b>Fu-Sang</b>
is only 30,000 <b>le</b> to the east of China, and merely 10,000 wide. Accordingly,
the Gulf is but "a few" <b>wan le</b> to the east of the Flowery Kingdom.</p>

<p>To look for the Canyon and Tree within the Philippine Islands, contiguous
to China, is simply impossible. The islands have been pretty well thrashed<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 14]</span>
over lately, and no one has met with the Tree! It has a "Trunk of 300 le,"
and collectors of curios or strange plants should keep wide awake and see that
they don't pass it in the dark. And yet with its Ten Moons, how miss it?
How fail to notice our glittering, gleaming, glorious candelabrum? It couldn't
have fallen or drifted over to the Panama ditch? It can't possibly be now
stuck in any South American Flower-pot? Catching the Tree seems to be as
slippery as catching Tartars, and perhaps when the first is found, the others
won't be very far off.</p>

<p>The Chinese commentator, of course, never saw either the Gulf or Canyon
but he quotes from earlier writers who were well acquainted with our "region
beyond the Eastern Sea;" and one of these named <b>Chwangtsze</b>, is quoted to
the effect that in the <b>Ta Hoh</b> or Great Canyon <b>high winds</b> (<b>yuen fung</b>) occur
(<b>yu</b>) or come unexpectedly upon one.</p>

<p>Do storms arise suddenly in the neighborhood of the mighty chasm?</p>

<p>One modern explorer says: "I go up to explore the alcove. While away a
whirlwind comes scattering the camp fire among the dead willows and cedar
spray and soon there is a conflagration, the men rushing for the boats, leaving
all they cannot readily seize at the moment, and even then they have their
clothing burned and hair singed." (note 31.)</p>

<p>Storms occur in all parts of the world. Is there anything peculiar about
the tempests which are said to suddenly arise in the Great Canyon?</p>

<p>One visitor says: "Storms were not infrequent and these occurring where
the canyon walls were a mile high and close together produced an effect that
was almost supernatural in its awfulness. The deep thunder echoed sharply
between the cliffs, producing a roaring sound that was almost deafening."
(note 32.)</p>

<p>It should be remembered that the vast caverns here multiply the bellowings
of thunder and also help to confine and intensify the raging and imprisoned
whirlwinds.</p>

<p>One eye or ear witness tells of a storm both seen and heard within the
Canyon and adds: "I have seen the lightning play and heard the thunder roll
among the summit peaks of the Rocky Mountains, as I have stood on some
rocky point far above the clouds, but <b>nowhere</b> has the awful grandeur
equalled that night in the lonesome depths of what was to us death's canyon....
Again all was shut in by darkness thicker than that of Egypt. The
stillness was only broken by the roar of the river as it rushed along beneath me.
Suddenly as if the mighty cliffs were rolling down against each other, there was
peal after peal of thunder striking against the marble cliffs below, and mingling
with their echoes, bounding from cliff to cliff. Thunder with echo, echo with
thunder, crossed and recrossed from wall to wall of the canyon," etc. (note 33.)</p>

<p>Surely sudden and dreadful storms rage here. The loudest in North
America, says an expert.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Observe that the visitor just quoted notices the "roar of the river" in connection
with the fury of the tempest.</p>

<p>Now, the ancient visitor does the same. After directing attention to the
sudden high winds, he says that a decidedly curious sight or spectacle (<b>king</b>
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 15]</span>
<b>shun</b>) is the <b>keang</b> (a large main stream which receives tributaries) spreading
abroad (<b>fu</b>) the <b>noise</b> of flowing water (<b>tsung</b>) in the <b>Ta-Hoh</b>
or Great Canyon.</p>

<p>The noise of the great river or <b>Keang</b> is thus noticed by the ancient
visitor, who also declares that the <b>Ta-Hoh</b> or Great Canyon constitutes a
decidedly fine or curious sight.</p>

<p>And such in truth it actually is. "Imagine a chasm that at times is less
than a quarter of a mile wide and more than a mile deep, the bed of which is
a tossing, <b>roaring</b>, madly impetuous flood.... What an imposing spectacle;
what a sublime vision of mightiness!" (n. 34).</p>

<p>A great sight! say the Ancients.</p>

<p>A Wonder of the World! say the Moderns.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The roar of the river has never ceased since the ancient scribe, or his
informant, passed that way. A modern visitor says: "The threatening <b>roar</b> of
the water is loud and constant."</p>

<p>Again, "The <b>roar</b> of its waters was heard unceasingly from the hour we
entered it until the time we landed here. No quiet in all that time." (n. 35).</p>

<p>One navigator tells of a "bore" in connection with the resounding stream.
"In the stillness of the night, the roaring of the huge mass could be heard
reverberating among the windings of the river.... This singular phenomenon
of the 'bore,' as it is called, is met with but at few places in the world.... In
the course of four or five hours the river falls about thirty feet" (n. 36.)</p>

<p>Another explorer pauses at one spot in his amphibious career to note that
"high water mark" can be seen "fifty, sixty, or a hundred feet above its present
stage;" and "when a storm bursts over the canyon, a side gulch is dangerous,
for a sudden flood may come and the inpouring waters will raise the river, so
as to hide the rocks before your eyes" (n. 37).</p>

<p>Another navigator, who never was without a life-belt,&mdash;which he found of
vital use when righting his too often overturned ark,&mdash;tells with amazement of
"the waves, torrents, and cataracts of this wildest of rivers."</p>

<p>A ceaseless basic roar is there,&mdash;deadened at times by floods of music, yet
nevertheless eternally there.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The sea connected with the Great Canyon is elsewhere called a <b>Puh hai</b>
(the latter term signifying "sea.")</p>

<p>A <b>Puh hai</b> is said to be a "Gulf," and we find a Gulf&mdash;the Gulf of California&mdash;at
the mouth of the Colorado.</p>

<p>It should, however, be observed that the term <b>Puh</b> by itself stands for "an
arm of the sea." A <b>Puh hai</b> is a Gulf which forms "an arm of the sea." The
Gulf or sea should be shaped like an <b>arm</b>&mdash;an arm of the ocean (see Williams'
dict. p. 718.)</p>

<p>Now, a glance at the map shows that in a very peculiar sense the Gulf of
California is a <b>hai</b> or "sea" which meets the requirements of being shaped
like an <b>arm</b>. It is a sea and a gulf and at the same time "an arm" of the
ocean. Truly it is a <b>Puh hai</b>.</p>

<p>A great many "gulfs" are quite unlike "arms," being too broad to admit<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 16]</span>
of such a comparison. But our Gulf of California is comparatively narrow and
is truly an "arm" of the sea. And notice how the water of the river&mdash;our
Colorado&mdash;"accumulates and so forms a gulf." Such are the words of the
existing translation and they apply completely to the American situation. Here
we find the water of the Colorado accumulating or widening out until it
becomes a great body of water&mdash;a Gulf. Indeed this development or process
of expansion is so gradual that it is impossible for navigators to tell where the
river ends or the gulf begins.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the Chinese comment immediately before us, however, the <b>hai</b> or sea to
the Canyon's river mouth is called a <b>Sheu</b>.</p>

<p>Now this term signifies "to rinse the mouth, to scour; to wash out a thing;
to purify." (Williams, p. 757.)</p>

<p>The word <b>Sheu</b> is written by combining the characters for "water" and
"to suck in."</p>

<p>It is evident that our Gulf of California is "an arm of the sea" and no less a
<b>Sheu</b>. A "mouth" it undoubtedly has, and this mouth is being ceaselessly
"washed," "scoured," and "purified." Even a dentist would be satisfied!
The immense stream rushes out, and tides from the Pacific rush in. Moreover
the Colorado "sucks in" the tidal wave known as the Bore. Surely we have
here the Eastern Gulf sea which is both a <b>Puh</b> and a <b>Sheu</b>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The water of the noisy, restless, purifying stream within the <b>Ta-Hoh</b> was
it is said,&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <b>Yu</b> (which means "used or employed.")</p>

<p>2. <b>Wuh</b> (to water or irrigate; to soften with water; to enrich.)</p>

<p>3. <b>Tsiao</b> (scorched, burned, singed, dried up.)</p>

<p>4. <b>Chi</b> (referring to or denoting.)</p>

<p>5. <b>Tsze</b> (here or this.)</p>

<p>Evidently the water of the Colorado was used to <b>irrigate</b> some ground or
vegetation which was dried up or <b>scorched</b>.</p>

<p>Such a remark implies a high temperature (during the period of growth)
between the walls of the chasm, and also leads us to look for some soil&mdash;some
scorched or dried up soil (sadly in need of irrigation)&mdash;between the jaws of the
Canyon. Is there parched or desert soil on the banks of the Colorado?</p>

<p>Here is the answer: "The region through which the chafing waters of the
Colorado run is forbidding in the extreme, a vast <b>Sahara</b> of waste and inutility;
a desert too dreary for either vegetable or animal life; a land that is
<b>haunted with wind-storm</b>, on which ride the furies of desolation....
The earth is <b>parched to sterility</b>.... It is like the moon, a <b>parched</b>
district, save for the single stream which, instead of supplying sustenance, is
eating its vitals." (note 38.)</p>

<p>Another traveler visited Fort Yuma, on the Colorado, and says: "The ride
to the fort was through a flat and desolate looking country.... It was a
dreary eight hours ride." Other remarks are made concerning "the barrenness
of the surrounding region and" "the <b>intense heat</b> of its summer
climate." (note 39.)<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 17]</span></p>

<p>In some spots, however, water produces magical effects. In the Mojave
valley, for instance, "the annual overflow of the river enables the Mojaves, to
raise with little labor, an abundant supply of provisions for the year.... During
one season, a few years since, the Colorado did not overflow its banks; there
were consequently no crops and great numbers of the Mojaves perished from
starvation." (note 40.)</p>

<p>Curiously enough, although rain fell furiously within the Canyon, it was
observed by a traveler that "such rain-storms were invariably confined to the
immediate vicinity of the Canyon, the territory lying two or three miles east or
west continuing parched with hardly a cloud above it." And the explorer
wonders how some ancient inhabitants, whose buildings are now in ruins,
"managed to exist, situated as they were in a desolate country, where there was
great scarcity of both vegetable and animal life."</p>

<p>The ancient Chinese account connects a baby king, a supreme ruler, with
the Great Canyon and now states that water was used within the gorge to
irrigate the soil, which is represented as being dried up or scorched. Is
the Canyon remarkable for its heat? Surely it ought to be cool down there?</p>

<p>One visitor says: "That Canyon was the sultriest place I have ever struck,
and my experience includes some of the hottest sections this side of the
equator.</p>

<p>The oppressive heat in the chasm was felt at a "point fifty times as deep
as the great chasm at Niagara." (note 41.)</p>

<p>"But despite the terrible heat, despite the discomfort of the situation, I was
compelled to wonder and admire, For,"&mdash;</p>

<p>The <b>Ta-Hoh</b> should constitute a magnificent sight, but it is also said to
contain some <b>scorched</b> or dried up soil. Is such to be seen?</p>

<p>An explorer reached the Colorado at a point where it is 266 yards wide,
and adds that the "soil" "bore nothing but dry weeds and bushes and the
whole scene presented the most perfect picture of desolation I have ever
beheld, as if some <b>sirocco</b> had passed over the land, <b>withering</b> and <b>scorching
everything</b>." (note 42.)</p>

<p>Withered and scorched! say the Ancients.</p>

<p>Withered and scorched! say the Moderns.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In one favored spot, "to the limit of vision, the tortuous course of the river
(the Colorado) could be traced through a belt of alluvial land varying from
one to six miles in width, and garnished with inviting meadows, with broad
groves of willow and mezquite and promising fields of grain." The visitor
remarks that the valley appears most attractive in the spring&mdash;"at this season of
the year before the <b>burning heat</b> has <b>withered</b> the freshness and beauty of
the early vegetation." (note 43.)</p>

<p>We are informed that the valley south of the Bend of the Colorado near
the "Needles," there is in the spring a "most brilliant array" of flowers; but,
"after the ephemeral influence of the few spring showers has passed, the
annual plants are soon <b>burned</b> up by the sun's heat and perfect sterility prevails
throughout the remainder of the season." (note 44.)</p>

<p>It is sufficiently apparent that the soil when properly watered can produce<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 18]</span>
abundant vegetation and sufficient nourishment for, of course, limited numbers
of human beings. Deprived of water, the soil is unable to sustain desirable
plants, and presents a sterile aspect. Surveying its present condition or appearance
of barrenness, a modern visitor wonders how the ancient inhabitants contrived
to exist, or find food, within the withered, unfruitful chasm. But one of
the ancients, Mr. Chwang Tsze, writing about this very <b>Ta-Hoh</b> or Great
Chasm, says that they used water to irrigate the otherwise scorched or dried up
soil. Then, if such a somewhat belated answer is true, the question arises,
where are the proofs?</p>

<p>A chief of the Ethnological Bureau very properly furnishes the answer.
Standing in the abyss of the <b>Ta-Hoh</b>, on the bank of the roaring river, he
beholds some ancient buildings and perceives how their vanished occupants
formerly contrived to subsist. He says: "We can see where the ancient people
who lived here&mdash;a race more highly civilized than the present&mdash;had made a
<b>garden</b>, and <b>used</b> a great spring" [or feeder of the Colorado], "that comes out
of the rocks for <b>irrigation</b>," etc. (n. 45.)</p>

<p>We irrigated the soil, say the Ancients.</p>

<p>They irrigated the soil, say the Moderns.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Next comes the statement of some trusted early sage or scholar who was
certainly acquainted with our <b>Ta-Hoh</b> (containing the ruin and irrigated soil
just noticed.) It is an observer or scribe named <b>Tu-tsan</b>, who says:&mdash;</p>

<p>10. <b>Seay</b> (to paint, to draw, to sketch.)</p>

<p>11. <b>yih</b> (to spread abroad, to diffuse.)</p>

<p>12. <b>tung</b> (a gorge, ravine, canyon, a cave, a grotto.)</p>

<p>13. <b>hueh</b> ("a hole in the earth or side of a hill,&mdash;they are used for dwellings;"
a den, a grotto, a cavern.)</p>

<p>Something called <b>seay</b> is here said to be spread abroad, or diffused over
rocky walls or caves. Williams (p. 796) says that <b>seay</b> (or <b>sie</b> as it is also
spelled) stands for a sketch or design, and adds that it means to draw, to compose,
to write. Morrison, in his dictionary, says that <b>seay</b> signifies "to paint,"
etc.</p>

<p>Of course there is no use looking for anything so absurd as pictured or
painted rocky walls or caves; and we accordingly feel disappointed when the
ancient text seems to notice such. The pictures or paint should be "spread
abroad" freely or lavishly in the vicinity of caverns, and we know positively
that no "paint" or pigment of human composition can be seen on the canyon
walls. No artificial pictures are there, and we are compelled to admit that the
ancient account here stands falsified.</p>

<p>We have, however, found the caves. Music Temple, for instance measures
two hundred feet from floor to roof, and is "a vast chamber carved out of
the rock." There are caverns in all directions. And the noisy, roaring river is
certainly there as well. One explorer says: "Imagine a chasm that at times is
less than a quarter of a mile wide and more than a mile deep, the bed of
which is a tossing, roaring, madly impetuous flood, winding its way in a sinuous
course along <b>walls</b> that are <b>painted</b> with all the pigments known to nature.
What an imposing spectacle!" (n. 46.)<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>Of course we must object that the "walls" are really not walls and that the
"paint" so lavishly spread upon them is not paint at all. The ancient assertion
is delusive, but equally so is the modern. Just compare them.</p>

<p>The Virgin River enters the Colorado, and at the place of junction are the
"resplendently <b>painted</b> temples and towers of the Virgin. Here the slopes,
the serpentine ledges, and the bosses of projecting rock, interlarded with scanty
soil, display all the colors of the rainbow, and in the distance may be likened
to the <b>painter's pallete</b>. The bolder tints are of maroon, purple, chocolate,
magenta, and lavendar, with broad bands of white laid in horizontal belts.
(n. 47.)</p>

<p>Is this so-called "paint" <b>lavishly</b> "spread abroad"?</p>

<p>Certainly; one section of the mighty and wondrous gorge is known as "the
<b>painted</b> canyon."</p>

<p>Of course the chasm is not really "painted" by artists or human agents,
and we need not look for painted cliffs anywhere. Nevertheless modern observers
echo the language of the ancients, and we are told today of "the
<b>painting</b> of the rocks" and of "deep, <b>painted</b> alcoves" and "<b>painted</b>
grottos" (n. 48.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The term <b>yih</b> (see Williams' dict. pp. 781, 1092) is composed of the characters
for "fluid" and "vessel," and signifies "A vessel full to the brim; ready to
overflow, to run over; abundant; to spread abroad, to diffuse." As <b>seay</b>, the
word which precedes <b>yih</b> in our Chinese note, signifies "to paint," we perceive
how the additional term <b>yih</b> teaches that the <b>paint</b> made use of has been
applied to extensive surfaces, so that it presents the appearance of having
"overflowed" or "run over" the rocky walls and caverns dealt with.</p>

<p>Of course neither writing nor literal pictures could overflow or drench&mdash;and
adhere to&mdash;walls or cliffs. But <b>seay yih</b> might cover the motion of applying
<b>paint</b> in a most lavish, copious, overflowing manner. Here are cliffs so
"rich with parti-coloring as to justify the most extravagant language in describing
them."</p>

<p>It looks as though the gnomes on the job, in the Canyon, just emptied their
paint-pots down dizzy cliffs and then went back for more. And such extravagance
is in harmony with the symbols which stand for painting and vessels and
spreading abroad or overflowing! Mineral paints were freely used and sometimes
apparently with considerable care and skill. Thus we read of a red
sandstone cliff "unbroken by cracks or crevices or ledges" exhibiting "extensive
flat surfaces beautifully <b>stained</b> by iron, till one could imagine all manner
of tapestry effects."</p>

<p>Here are painted imitations of tapestry.</p>

<p>It should further be remembered that there are actual picture writings
spread abroad on extensive painted or stained surfaces. The author just
quoted beheld ancient dwellings which "exhibited considerable skill on the part
of the builders, the corners being plumb and square." And just here "there
were also numerous picture writings." (note 49.)</p>

<p>An amazed visitor exclaims: "Grand, glorious, sublime, are the Pictorial
cliffs of vermillion hue!"<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>"Pictorial" answers to <b>seay</b> (the 10th character in our list.)</p>

<p>Pictured and painted! say the Ancients.</p>

<p>Pictured and painted! say the Moderns.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We have seen that our Gulf (of California) has been called a <b>Puh-hai</b>, or
"arm of the sea."</p>

<p>Professor Hoith, the celebrated student of Chinese, in his work on
"Chinese History" (p. 49, footnote) says that a <b>puh hai</b> is "an estuary."</p>

<p>Webster says that an "estuary" is "an arm of the sea; a firth; a narrow
passage, or the mouth of a river or lake, where the tide meets the current, or
flows and ebbs."</p>

<p>Plainly our Gulf of California is a <b>Puh hai</b> or Estuary.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It may further be remarked that <b>Puh</b> is written in Chinese by putting
together two characters, one standing for "water," and the other signifying
"Suddenly; hastily; flurried, disconcerted, as when caught doing wrong; to
change color, confused" (Williams' dict. p. 718.)</p>

<p>It is superfluous to say that our Gulf or Estuary is a very "confused" or
"flurried" body of water. It is truly a <b>Puh-hai</b>.</p>

<p>Moreover, it "changes color." As though "caught doing wrong," it
changes color and blushes at times a rosy red. This is the hue of multidunious
veins: "A thousand streams rolling down the cliffs on every side, carry with
them red sand; and these all unite in the canyon below, in one great stream of
red mud" (n. 50.) But sometimes the color below Yuma is yellow or black
(n. 51.)</p>

<p>The name "Colorado" is a Spanish term conveying the idea of redness,
and undoubtedly this hue predominates throughout the course of the boisterous
stream; but other colors due to the dye or wash of variously painted cliffs, are
also met with. Moreover a section may exhibit one color to-day and something
different to-morrow. And so it is with the gulf, which receives the Colorado,
and on which floating patches of color are frequently seen. Truly our Gulf or
Estuary is remarkable for both its coloring, blue, red, etc., and its changes of
color. In all respects it is plainly a <b>Puh-hai</b>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our Gulf or Estuary is also called a <b>yuen</b>. Farther on (see Chinese version)
we read that the Canyon river produces or grows into (<b>shang</b>) a beautiful
(<b>kan</b>) <b>yuen</b>.</p>

<p>This term <b>yuen</b> stands for a "gulf, an abyss; an eddy, a whirlpool or place
where the back water seems to stop."</p>

<p>A whirling, violent, or impetuous body of water is evidently referred to.
Fernando Alarchon, in 1540, found the Colorado "a very mighty river, which
ran with so great a fury of stream that we could hardly sail against it.</p>

<p>One voyager tells how his ark, the "Emma" was "caught in a <b>whirlpool</b>,
and set spinning about." Here is a <b>yuen</b>.</p>

<p>Again, "The men in the boats above see our trouble but they are caught
in whirlpools, and are spinning about in eddies."</p>

<p>What have we here but <b>Yuen</b>&mdash;multiplied whirlpools?<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>Through "Whirlpool Canyon" and all the way to the Gulf, the waters dance
around and about. We read of "dancing eddies or whirlpools." There are
more than 600 rapids and falls in the Colorado (n. 52.)</p>

<p>The waters <b>waltz</b> their way and even furnish their own "rippling, rushing,
roaring music." And we are in addition told of "innumerable cascades adding
their wild music" (n. 53).</p>

<p>Surely the entire inlet traversed by the bore or reached by ocean tides is
in precisely the condition of commotion which may well be designated by the
term yuen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are informed that the <b>kan</b> (or beautiful) <b>yuen</b> approaches (<b>tsih</b>)
with vapor (<b>hi hwo</b>) and bathes (<b>yuh</b>) the sun's place (<b>ji chi su</b>).</p>

<p>It is evident that the mighty stream which traverses the Great Canyon in
the region beyond the Eastern Sea, should flow from a Bottomless valley to a
Gulf, and reach to the Sun's Place. And we find that the current of the Colorado
extends to the Tropical line of Cancer, which crosses and marks the
mouth of the Gulf of California.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vapor or fog is noticed in connection with the beautiful (even if restless or
reeling) <b>Yuen</b>.</p>

<p>Are fogs a noticeable feature along the coast of California? If so, they
might hide the entrance or mouth of the Gulf.</p>

<p>One visitor says: "Westward toward the setting sun and the sea," was a
"filmy fog creeping landward, swallowing one by one the distant hills."</p>

<p>Again, we read of "hilltops that thrust their heads through the slowly vanishing
vapor."</p>

<p>Here "you may bask in the sunshine of gardens of almost tropic luxuriance
or shudder in <b>fogs that shroud the coast</b>" (n. 54.)</p>

<p>We need not wonder that such vapors should appear within the confines
of the charming Gulf of California and at times veil its shores. A recent visitor
says: "The island and mountain peaks, whose outlines are seen from the
Gulf, had been somewhat <b>dimmed</b> by a light <b>haze</b>, appeared surprisingly
near and distinct in the limpid medium through which they were now viewed.
The whole panorama became invested with new attractions, and it would be
hard to say whether the dazzling radiance of the day or the sparkling clearness
of the night was the more <b>beautiful</b> and brilliant" (n. 55).</p>

<p>Hazy and Beautiful, say the Ancients.</p>

<p>Hazy and Beautiful, say the Moderns.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The haze is not dense enough to blind our eyes to the manifest fact that
those people of old who were acquainted with the position of our Gulf of California,
must also have been acquainted with Mexico and its inhabitants.</p>

<p>Tropical America was considered by its people to be particularly under
the influence of the Sun. Uxmal was in "the Land of the Sun" (n. 56), and the
Mexicans called themselves "Children of the Sun."</p>

<h2>CAVE DWELLINGS IN THE GRAND CANYON.</h2>

<p>It will be noticed that the 13th term in our list is <b>hueh</b>, which stands for
cave habitation. Are such to be seen in our Canyon?</p>

<p>Numerous <b>tung</b> (see 12th term,) in the shape of caves or holes are undoubtedly
there, but in addition the old account notices <b>hueh</b>. Have such been
found?</p>

<p>One explorer says: "Even more remarkable than the stupendous walls
which confine the Colorado river, are the ruined cave habitations which are to
be seen along the lofty and inaccessible ledges, in which a vanished race long
years ago evidently sought refuge from their enemies.... They were reached
by very narrow, precipitous, and devious paths, and being extremely difficult to
attain by the occupants themselves, presented an impregnable front to invaders"
(n. 57.)</p>

<p>Explorers decending into the <b>ta-hoh</b> come forth to-day with accounts of
gardens and irrigating streams, pictured cliffs, and cave dwellings,&mdash;in complete
agreement with the ancient record.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following the term <b>hueh</b> we find a 14th, called <b>han</b>, which stands for dry,
heated air; too dry; parched as by drought; crisp.</p>

<p>Is there <b>han</b>, or dry heated air down in the Canyon?</p>

<p>One visitor entered the Grand Canyon "in the morning while darkness yet
covered the scene, but even then it was oppressively hot, and as the sun got
higher I felt as though I had been thrust into a dutch <b>oven</b> and the mouth
stopped up.... But, despite the terrible heat ... I was compelled to wonder
and admire ... the gorgeous cliffs and rock walls showing all those varied
colorings," etc. (n. 58).</p>

<p>It was the "terrible heat" which compelled the Ancients to resort to irrigation
in order to raise some food for themselves and little ones. Destitute of
water, the soil is scorched and barren.</p>

<p>It is said that "there are about 700 square miles of arable land between the
mouth of the Gila and the 35th parallel of N. latitude," along the Colorado.
And "in the valley" of this stream, where it is joined by the Gila, "are traces
of ancient irrigating canals, which show that it has once been cultivated." And
along the connected Gila are irrigating works of remarkable construction and
undoubted antiquity&mdash;antedating the arrival of the Spaniards by centuries.</p>

<p>Where the soil is actually irrigated or cultivated the response of nature is
most gratifying and encouraging. We learn with regard to the Colorado valley,
that "portions are cultivated by the numerous tribes of Indians who live along
its banks, affording them an abundance of wheat, maize, beans, melons,
squashes," etc. (n. 59).</p>

<p>Such ground would be well worthy of attention; but the attitude of "the
numerous tribes of Indians" along the Colorado might interfere with the plans
of newcomers and even compel the latter to live in caves or on ledges easily
defended. And it is certain that soil insufficiently watered presents a distressingly
sterile aspect in the neighborhood of the Colorado.</p>

<p>One traveler, already quoted, says with regard to a wide section, that "the<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 23]</span>
whole scene presented the most perfect picture of desolation I have ever beheld,
as if some Sirocco had passed over the land, <b>withering</b> and <b>scorching</b>
everything to crispness" (n. 60.)</p>

<p>Notice this word "crispness" used by our author. Turned into Chinese it
becomes <b>han</b> (crisp)&mdash;the very term applied in the ancient record to the condition
of the soil unwatered within the Canyon. It is curious how the old and
new visitors agree in their descriptions of the interior of the mighty gorge,
where vegetation is withered or dead.</p>

<p>Scorched and Crisp! say the Ancients.</p>

<p>Scorched and Crisp! say the Moderns.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Canyon should be hot, and one of our own visitors says: "The sun
shone directly up the Canyon, and the glare <b>reflected from the walls</b> made
the heat intolerable (n. 61.)</p>

<p>The word <b>han</b> has, unfortunately enough, a perfect right to appear in the
old record. Following it we find additional terms:</p>

<p>15. A compound character consisting of the signs for "Sun" (<b>Jih</b>) and
"People" (<b>Min</b>.)</p>

<p>16. <b>lung</b> ("used for <b>nagas</b> or snake gods;" "a dragon," "imperial." "It is
often used for a man.")</p>

<p>17. <b>chuh</b> ("the illumination of torches; a candle; a light; to give or shed
light upon, to illumine")</p>

<p>The statement seems to teach that the Sun People&mdash;the men&mdash;were using
torches to illumine the depth of the hot Canyon.</p>

<p>We have already been informed that a <b>ju</b> or suckling, who was yet a
supreme King (like perhaps the last Chinese Emperor of the Manchu dynasty,
in 1912 A. D.) and a Child of the Sun, was down in the abyss, so we are prepared
to hear that his subjects&mdash;some Sun people&mdash;were down there too.</p>

<p>Of course, for the greater part of the twenty-four hours, the darkness,
particularly in the cave dwellings should be most intense. One visitor, quoted
already, tells of "darkness thicker than that of Egypt." Such gloom should be
particularly and painfully felt by "Sun People," and we are not surprised to
find that they made use of torches or artificial lights. Singularly enough, the
chasm, as though remorsefully conscious of the blackness of its character, produces
no end of dried-up vegetable stems or stalks fit to be ignited and used
as firebrands. These it places convenient to your hand, as though to invite
inspection.</p>

<p>Indians today are in the habit of using such torches. We are informed
that "the custom still prevails among them of carrying a firebrand," which was
noticed by Spanish explorers in the 16th Century, "and induced those discoverers
to give to the river the name of Rio del Tizon" (n. 62).</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the ancient Chinese account connects lights, or "an
illumination of Torches" (<b>chuh</b>), with the very stream which the Spaniards of
a later age, and of their own accord christened the Rio del Tizon.</p>

<p>A Torch-lighted stream, say the Chinese.</p>

<p>A Torch-lighted stream, say the Spaniards.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The author or explorer last quoted says with reference to Indians dwelling
on the banks of the Colorado, that "the custom still prevails among them of
carrying a firebrand in the hand in cold weather," which was noticed by the
Spaniards.</p>

<p>Of course the flaming brands may well be used in winter to warm those
who hold them, but the Ancients who inhabited the cave or cliff houses
(which they built and which are now more or less in ruin, according to exposure
or original inherent strength) might have used the <b>chuh</b> or torches as
<b>lights</b>. These torches are mentioned in connection with excessive <b>heat</b>, and
it would be absurd to suppose that the Sun People of old desired a still higher
temperature. But mention is made of cave dwellings, and such are actually
there; and we can readily understand why the ancient dwellers in the cave
houses should have frequently used the ready-to-hand torches when climbing
to their dark and break-neck abodes.</p>

<p>Even today the <b>chuh</b> or torches are used as <b>lights</b>. The withered
stalks or stems, so abundant in the Canyon, are a melancholy illustration of the
scorching power of the sun within the chasm. We have not forgotten the fact
that the Chinese term <b>han</b> is used in the ancient text and that it stands for the
"crispness" of scorched or dried up plants. An actual visit to the <b>Ta-Hoh</b> or
Great Canyon referred to, shows that it is this <b>han</b>&mdash;or withered, scorched and
crisp&mdash;vegetation which provides no end of torches (<b>chuh</b>) for dwellers in the
vicinity. One stumbling visitor uses the following language: "We struck for
it ... through the thick night, the guide occasionally lighting a <b>torch of grass</b>"
(n. 63). Unable to directly or steadily illumine the angles or recesses of the
Canyon, the bright and clear-headed sun does the next best thing and raises a
bounteous harvest of firebrands. Nature here concentrates her attention on the
task of serving the necks (rather than the bellies) of her children, and presents
them with a crop of seasoned and brilliant torches. Certain it is that most
efficient firebrands are raised here in profusion and constitute such a unique
feature of the stream that in order to distinguish it from others in the region,
the Spaniards called our river the Rio del Tizon. Torches have lighted the
Canyon in the past and they now throw light on the ancient record.</p>

<p>Mentioned in connection with withered vegetation and intense heat, the
natural inference is that the torches were used to <b>light</b> the steps of dwellers in
the Canyon. Of course they might in winter have been used, like other vegetable
produce, as fuel, but the old record now before us does actually connect
the <b>chuh</b> or torches with a high scorching temperature; and our impression or
deduction is that they were used as lights amid the blackness of the chasm.</p>

<p>And the Torches (<b>chuh</b>) are used as lights still. One explorer says: "We
fear that we shall have to stay here clinging to the rocks until daylight. Our
little Indian gathers a few dry stems, ties them in a bundle, lights one end, and
holds it up. The <b>others do the same</b>, and with these <b>Torches</b> we <b>find a
way</b> out of trouble."</p>

<p>Observe that these torches (or <b>chuh</b> as the Chinese would call them)
were not ignited to <b>warm</b> the explorers. They were held aloft to find or light
the way among perilous cliffs. Without their aid it would have been madness<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 25]</span>
for the explorers to move. Practically they were as men born blind, but the
Indian guide, with knowledge derived from the depths of antiquity, obtains
the necessary torches and light at his elbow. With one withered and hot stem
he ties together a number, lights them and then finds the way out of trouble
for both himself and his bewildered party. What have we here but a duplication
of the "illumination of torches" referred to in the ancient record?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>17. <b>chuh</b> (the illumination of torches; a candle; a torch.)</p>

<p>18. <b>yuen</b> ("to lead or take by the hand, to cling to; to pull up higher, to
drag out; to put forward; to relieve, to rescue")</p>

<p>19. <b>yiu</b> (have, has; to get.)</p>

<p>20. <b>Ta</b> (Great.)</p>

<p>21. <b>Hoh</b> (Canyon.)</p>

<p>22. <b>hao</b> (a mark, classed, a signal.)</p>

<p>23. <b>wei</b> (said or declared; has; in the place of.)</p>

<p>24. <b>wu</b> (no; without; destitute of.)</p>

<p>25. <b>te</b> (bottom.)</p>

<p>It appears that within the bottomless <b>Ta-hoh</b> or Great Canyon (see words
19 to 25) there is an illumination of torches (<b>chuh</b>) and a pulling up higher, or
a dragging about and clinging to (<b>yuen</b>).</p>

<p>Climbing is here referred to. The Sun people seem to have found locomotion
difficult and hazardous within the chasm.</p>

<p>The modern explorer who reached the irrigated garden plots and houses
of the ancient occupants, was himself compelled to resort to much climbing.
In one place he says: "I find I can get up no farther, and cannot step back, for
I dare not let go with my hands, and cannot reach foot-hold below without. I
call to Bradley for help.... The moment is critical. Standing on my toes my
muscles begin to tremble.... I hug close to the rock, let go with my hand,
seize the dangling legs, and with his assistance, I am enabled to gain the top"
(n. 64.)</p>

<p>It will be seen by the intelligent reader that the forgoing performance is
covered by the term <b>yuen</b> (No. 18) used in the ancient record. There was a
<b>rescue</b> by Bradley, and the desperate adventurer, a chief of the Ethnological
Bureau, was "pulled up higher," even to "the top" of the cliff. All this constitutes
<b>yuen</b>; and without intending it, our modern climber&mdash;calling to Bradley
for help&mdash;is a most eloquent and lucid commentator on the ancient statement
in the Chinese text.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But this climbing should be accomplished in connection with <b>chuh</b> (No.
17&mdash;the illumination of torches). Is it true that there is climbing by torchlight
(not <b>moonlight</b>, gentle reader) within the chasm?</p>

<p>Light is thrown on the ancient text by a statement already in part quoted:
"We fear that we shall have to stay here <b>clinging</b> to the rocks until daylight.
Our little Indian gathers a few dry stems, ties them in a bundle, lights one end,
and holds it up. The others do the same, and with these torches we find a
way out of trouble. <b>Helping</b> each other, holding <b>torches</b> for each other, one
<b>clinging</b> to another's <b>hand</b> until we get footing, then supporting the other on<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 26]</span>
his shoulders, so we make our passage into the depths of the canyon. And
now Captain Bishop has kindled a huge fire of driftwood, on the bank of the
river. This and the fires in the gulch opposite, and our own <b>flaming torches</b>,
light up little patches, that make more manifest the awful darkness below.
Still, on we go, for an hour or two, and at last we see Captain Bishop coming
up the gulch, with a <b>huge</b> torch-light on his shoulders. He looks like a fiend
waving brands and lighting the fires of hell, and the men in the opposite gulch
are imps lighting delusive fires in inaccessible crevices, over yawning chasms....
At last we meet Captain Bishop with his flaming torch" (n. 65). And so
the brilliant description continues.</p>

<p>What is all this but the <b>chuh yuen</b> of the ancient record? Here surely is
"an illumination of torches."</p>

<p>Torches and Climbing, say the Ancients.</p>

<p>Torches and Climbing, say the Moderns.</p>

</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can readily understand why the ancient occupants of the stone houses
in the Grand Canyon, should have used the torches so liberally and conveniently
supplied by nature throughout the region where their light is too often
sadly or desperately needed. We have been informed by a modern visitor
that ruined cave habitations are to be seen along "lofty and inaccessible ledges."
And these dwellings "were reached by very narrow, precipitous, and devious
paths, and being extremely difficult to attain by the occupants themselves, presented
an impregnable front to invaders."</p>

<p>Surely here torches would often come in handy.</p>

<p>Dr. Fewkes believes that the ancient occupants of the cliff or cave houses
chose hazardous sites in order to be out of the reach of enemies. He says:<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>"The pressure of outside tribes, or what may be called human environment,
probably had much to do originally with the choice of caves for houses. The
experienced archaeologist also draws attention to Jackson's remark that finger
imprints answering to those of women, "may still be traced in the mortar" of
the dwellings (n. 66). Many interiors indeed are covered with smooth plaster
in which the impressions of small and delicate fingers appear.</p>

<p>Of course, women and children formerly lived on the "inaccessible ledges";
and sons, fathers, husbands, or brothers, away perhaps hunting in distant glens
or forests, were comparatively free from anxiety concerning the condition of
loved ones at home. And if savages with tomahawks and scalping knives
came stealing through ravines to the foot of impregnable stairways, the mothers
aloft, pressing children to their breasts and looking down on baffled foes, must
have felt something of the emotion which throbs through the well-known lines,
written indeed by a woman,&mdash;</p>


<div class="blockquot"><p>

</p></div>

<p>And if in the darkness of night, the awaited signal or cry were heard arising
from the heart of the abyss, how quickly the doors would be opened and
ropes lowered and torches lighted to help the hunters to their homes on high!
Torches flaming and eyes gleaming. Lights flashing in all directions. An
illumination of torches. No wonder the Canyon was noted for its <b>chuh yuen</b>
and cave dwellings.</p>

<p>Lights, Climbing, and Caves, say the Ancients.</p>

<p>Lights, Climbing, and Caves, say the Moderns.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The account continues thus:</p>

<p>26. <b>Leang</b> (the principal, the chief; a bridge, a beam.)</p>

<p>27. <b>kien</b> (official writing; to mark; a slip of bamboo for making notes on;
a classifier of folios or sheets.)</p>

<p>28. <b>wan</b> (strokes, lines, literature, literary; a despatch.)</p>

<p>29. <b>Ta</b> (Great.)</p>

<p>30. <b>Hoh</b> (Canyon.)</p>

<p>31. <b>fu</b> (to spread abroad as decrees; to exact; to demand.)</p>

<p>A <b>leang</b> or chief is here referred to in connection with the Great Canyon.
The ruler is not exactly called the King or supreme head (<b>chwen suh</b>). Indeed,
we have been already informed that the head ruler was a mere nurseling
(at the time when he abandoned his Lute in the Canyon) and such an
infant carried about by the mother who had just brought him into the world,
among the cliffs and canyons, would evidently have been unable to either write
or issue decrees. Of course, however, a nominally subordinate chief (or<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 28]</span>
<b>leang</b>) might have attended to the details of government and ruled or directed
the movements of the Sun people in the name of the infant King. Such a
minister might have spread abroad decrees or commands within the Canyon.</p>

<p>Are any writings to be seen on its walls?</p>

<p>An explorer already in part quoted, says: "At last we meet Captain Bishop
with his flaming torch.... On a broad shelf we find the ruins of an old stone
house, the walls of which are broken down, and we can see where the ancient
people who lived here&mdash;a race more highly civilized than the present&mdash;had
made a garden, and used a great spring, that comes out of the rocks, for irrigation.
On some rocks near by we discover some curious etchings" (n. 67).</p>

<p>Here are cliff writings.</p>

<p>Again, on the brink of a rock 200 feet high stands an old house. Its walls
are of stone, laid in mortar, with much regularity.... On the face of the cliff,
under the building and along down the river for 200 or 300 yards, there are
many etchings."</p>

<p>Here are writings "spread abroad" within the <b>Ta-hoh</b> or Great Canyon.
Not painted on the cliffs, but cut into the stone! Beyond the reach or malice
of savage tribes, they doubtless furnished directions to friendly clans, telling
where certain companies had moved, and so forth.</p>

<p>"On many of the tributaries of the Colorado I have heretofore examined
their deserted dwellings.... Sometimes the mouths of caves have been walled
across and there are many other evidences to show their anxiety to secure
defensible positions. Probably the nomadic tribes were sweeping down upon
them, and they resorted to these cliffs and canyons for safety.... Here I stand
where these now lost people stood centuries ago, and look over this strange
country."</p>

<p>The former chief of the Ethnological Bureau also says that at the mouth of
the Colorado Chiquito he discovered some curious remains, such as ruins and
pottery, also "etchings and hieroglyphics on the rocks."</p>

<p>Some of the cliff or cave dwellings are singularly impressive. Baron Nordenskiold,
says of one, called the "Cliff Palace," that it well deserves its proud
name, "for with its round towers and high walls ... deep in the mysterious
twilight of the cavern, and defying in their sheltered site the ravages of time, it
resembled at a distance an enchanted castle."</p>

<p>And Chapin exclaims: "Surely its discoverer had not overstated the beauty
and magnitude of this strange ruin. There it was, occupying a great oval space
under a grand cliff wonderful to behold, appearing like an immense ruined castle
with dismantled towers" (n. 68).</p>

<p>And yet Dr. Fewkes very rationally refuses to regard it as a "palace"&mdash;occupied
merely by a king and servants or else officers of state managing an
empire. Of course some nook within sheltered its ruler. But it is merely a
pueblo&mdash;set within a cave. One French visitor says: "Il est probable que Cliff-Palace
n'abritait pas moins de 500 personnes" (n. 69).</p>

<p>At this rate it would have required forty such structures (or equivalent
clusters of apartments) to shelter, say, 20,000 individuals.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>There is mention of cave dwellings in connection with the Great Canyon;
and as Sun people with a supreme ruler (although but a suckling) are represented
as climbing within the chasm, with the aid of torches, we expect to find
curious remains in connection with the caverns. Nor are we disappointed.
Here are mouths of caves walled up for defensive purposes. Here are ramparts,
towers, and fortified structures classed with castles.</p>

<p>We are informed that decrees were spread abroad in the Canyon; and
searching for the ancient inscriptions, we find that they are cut into the cliffs.
This shows that the former dwellers were able to cut and work stone; and
abundant remains of masonry are at hand to sustain this deduction.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The personality of the <b>ju</b>, or suckling ruler, remains to be investigated,
and should yield curious&mdash;most surprising&mdash;results; but, of course, reasonable,
logical critics will not for an instant confound such an inquiry with that just
finished. Even absolute failure to unearth the facts with regard to the Prince
and his royal mother, can not shake the plain fact that we have actually found
an account of the Grand Canyon, the Colorado River, and the Gulf of California,
in an ancient Chinese book.</p>


<h2>PIMO AND THE CASAS GRANDES</h2>

<p>It may further be remarked that the Chinese paragraph which immediately
follows the account of our Canyon, mentions a place called "Pi-mo."</p>

<p>This is its pronunciation in Canton, but in Shanghai, where <b>mo</b> is accorded
the sound of <b>mu</b> (see Williams' dict. p. 1154 and p. 1186, column 6) <b>Pi-mo</b>
would be called <b>Pi-mu</b>. Now, this Pi-mo or Pi-mu is said (see existing translation)
to be situated in the "south-east corner of the desert beyond the eastern
sea.</p>

<p>Proceeding eastward until the "Eastern Sea," which washes the coast of
China, is crossed, the modern investigator reaches California and Arizona. And
here, in the region or basin of the Colorado, he finds a place still called "Pi-mo."
It is in Arizona, with a "desert" of sand&mdash;the desert of California and Sonora&mdash;to
its west and south, and a region of running streams, grass, and forests to its
east. <b>Pimo</b> is itself in the "desert"&mdash;in a "south-east corner of the desert beyond
the Eastern Sea." It is entirely dependent on artificial irrigation for its
limited power to support human beings.</p>

<p>Here are ruined buildings whose origin is shrouded in mystery and around
or about which controversies have raged for centuries.</p>

<p>One visitor, an American officer, states that his General "asked a Pimo,
who made the house I had seen?" The house was one of the Casas Grandes
in the neighborhood of Pimo. Who had made it? was now the question.
The reply was: "It was built by the son of the most beautiful woman who
once dwelt in yon mountain; she was fair and all the handsome men came to
court her, but in vain; when they came, they paid tribute, and out of this small
store she fed all people in times of famine and it did not diminish."</p>

<p>Moreover, "at last she brought forth a boy, who was the builder of all
these houses."<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>The Pimo Indian "seemed unwilling to talk about them, but said there
were plenty more of them to the north, south, west, etc." (note 70.)</p>

<p>[Was the royal suckling or Prince ever carried down into the neighboring
Grand Canyon by the beneficient being, his mother? Was he a <b>shao hao</b> (as
the Chinese might say) or little Child of the Sun? Did he ever see the Cliff
Palace? Were he and his people connected with the cave and cliff-dwellings?
And when he retired from the Canyon did he fail to take with him a Lute?]</p>

<p>If the royal suckling (or <b>ju</b>) of the Chinese account ever actually lived in
the neighborhood of the Grand Canyon, or in the vicinity of Pimo, and was
connected with a restless or troubled nation of Cliff Dwellers or stone-house
builders, why should not the Indians have some traditional, even if but hazy
recollection of both the suckling and his imperial mother? The forefathers of
the Pimos must have beheld them, and it is difficult to suppose that the
ancient legendary knowledge has completely evaporated from the aboriginal
memory. As we have learned the construction of the Casas Grandes at Pimo
is connected with the advent or movements of an intelligent, even if harassed
race of Builders who owed allegiance to a Princess or her child. And if it is a
fact that in a time of famine the royal lady fed the ancestors of the Pimos, we
wonder not that the nation has enshrined her image within its ceaseless,
throbbing heart. The hill-top on which she gave birth to her suckling is
remembered to the present hour and was pointed to by the Pimo interpreter
when telling the American General about the merciful being who fed the
hungry in a time of famine (and perhaps had relieved or cheered his own
ancestor.)</p>

<p>Let us not overlook or snub the fact that Pimo&mdash;the Pimo of "the region
beyond the Eastern Sea" is actually mentioned in the same breath with the
Grand Canyon and the Gulf. It is represented by characters numbered 9 and
10 in the extract from the ancient Chinese volume, now set before the patient
and intelligent reader who appreciates or perceives the difficulties connected
with the present investigation.</p>

<p>The last column (reading from right to left) consists of 12 characters, which
express the following sense: <b>Ta</b>&mdash;<b>Hg</b>&mdash;east&mdash;south&mdash;corner&mdash;<b>has</b>&mdash;<b>shan</b> (mountain
or height)&mdash;called&mdash;<b>Pi mo</b>&mdash;<b>ti</b>&mdash;<b>kiu</b>.</p>

<p>The 11th term, <b>ti</b>, stands for "place;" and a <b>kiu</b> is a level-topped hill. As
it is also called a <b>shan</b> (see No. 7), the <b>kiu</b> should be a prominent eminence
having a level space on top.</p>

<p>The name <b>Pi-mo</b> is expressed by putting <b>Pi</b>, which signifies "skin" or
"case," along with <b>mo</b>, which simply stands for "mother."</p>

<p>A mother, or a maternal case is connected with the <b>Pi-mo kiu</b> or level-topped
hill. Is such an eminence to be seen in the vicinity of Pi-mo? Has it
a flat summit? Are there any signs that it was inhabited by the queen of the
Builders? The Pimo Indian told the general that on the hill-top in the vicinity&mdash;in
the Lower Gila Valley&mdash;a female ruler gave birth to a child. Is there
any foundation for the legend? Where is her house?</p>

<p>Referring to the structures in Arizona, an observer draws particular attention
to one "comparatively intact in the lower Gila valley." He says: "The
<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 31]</span>
hill on which it is built rises abruptly from the surrounding lowlands to the
height of a full thousand feet. Near the northwest corner the ancient strategists
began at a height of thirty feet, carving a narrow pathway to the summit.
Here an irregular stone staircase has been made, passable by one person at a
time. At intervals watchtowers were constructed, from which huge boulders
could be hurled down upon the advancing foe.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 404px;">
<img src="images/fig_004.jpg" width="404" height="1024" alt="" title="" />
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'>[Pg 32]</span>"The
road makes three complete circles above the hill before reaching the
upper <b>level</b>." [Here is a <b>level</b>-topped hill or <b>kiu</b>.] "Here another monument
of early fortitude inspired by the love of life presents itself. There is, perhaps,
three acres of <b>level</b> rock on the summit. For a depth of nearly two feet the
entire <b>plateau</b> is covered with rich soil 'packed up' from below. When one
pauses to think of the immense labor involved in carrying this mass of earth
up the irregular winding stone staircase, a feeling of admiration springs up for
these simple patient people."</p>

<p>It is plain that there is a <b>level</b>-topped hill (or <b>kiu</b>) in the vicinity of Pimo.
And it is directly connected in Indian tradition with the movements of a race of
builders who reared "all these houses," and were directed or governed by a
beneficient being who here gave birth to a remarkable prince. But it is enough
at present to observe that the Chinese symbols connect Pimo&mdash;the Pimo of the
"region beyond the Eastern Sea"&mdash;with a Mother, or notable Birth. And when
the American General&mdash;in our region beyond the Eastern Sea&mdash;inquires at
Pimo for information, concerning its now silent and forsaken ruins, the Pimo interpreter
instantly responds by raising his arm and pointing to the hill of the
royal birth.</p>

<p>The Hill of the Maternal Case is there, say the Chinese.</p>

<p>The Hill of the Maternal Case is Here, say the Pimos.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hill is prominent or lofty and quite level on top. It is in truth a <b>kiu</b>
(pronounced like our own word cue) and holds aloft some impregnable
dwellings and also a green spot or abandoned garden&mdash;clay having been
carried aloft a thousand feet by devoted Builders in part to raise flowers for the
young mother. But, of course, her own bud was the brightest of all. And
every one told her so. And what a wide view from the summit! And how
cool the air up there! How different from the blazing Canyon (with its hidden
or abandoned Lute.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The General asked a Pimo, who made the house I had seen? 'It is the
Casa de Montezuma', said he; it was built by the son of the most beautiful
woman who once dwelt in yon mountain; she was fair&mdash;"</p>

<p>Notice here the name "Montezuma."</p>

<p>The Casas Grandes at Pimo were fortunately seen by Spanish explorers in
the 16th century, and "the Indians then assigned them an age of no less than
500 years." (note 71.)</p>

<p>Of course the Casa Grande Montezuma (or Builder Prince of the 11th
century) could not have been the Montezuma who was overthrown by Cortez
in the 16th century. As well confound William of Normandy with William of
Holland, because each was a William! Let fools do that!<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>One writer says with regard to the legends of the sedentary Indians, that
"the name of Montezuma runs through all of these&mdash;not generally referring to
the king whom we are accustomed to identify with that name, but to the great
chief of the golden or heroic age." (n. 72)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are noticeable variations in the name or title of the ancient king.
Thus one Spanish explorer speaks of "the Casa Grande, or palace of <b>Moc</b>-te-zuma"
(n. 73.)</p>

<p>Here we have <b>Moc</b> (or <b>Mok</b>, as it is by others spelled) instead of <b>Mon</b> (ti-zuma.)</p>

<p>Another authority furnishes the spelling <b>Mo</b>-te-cuh-<b>zoma</b>, and adds, that
it is "found written also <b>Moc</b>-te-zuma, Mu-teczuma, Mo-texuma" (n. 74.)</p>

<p>Notice the three different spellings or sounds&mdash;<b>Mo</b>, <b>Mu</b>, and <b>Mok</b>, prefixed
to "<b>te-zuma</b>...."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The title <b>te</b> or <b>ti</b> (or <b>te-cuh</b>) signifies warrior or lordly ruler (n. 75.) As
for <b>suma</b> it is said to mean "sad, angry, or severe." [But <span class="smcap">soma</span> may include
an allusion to the water of immortality and embrace the notion of divine
descent.]</p>

<p><b>Mok</b> (the <b>te-zuma</b>) <b>Mo</b> or <b>Mu</b> were names or titles bestowed on the
11th century Builder Prince who was connected with the construction of the
Casas Grandes in the Pimo section, and was born on a prominent hill-top there.
He was <b>Mok</b>, <b>Mo</b> or <b>Mu</b>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Turning to the Chinese account we find that the royal <b>ju</b> or suckling
connected with the region of the Grand Canyon and Pimo, was likewise known
as <b>Mu</b>. (note 76.)</p>

<p>In addition, the suckling is repeatedly called a <b>ti</b> (or <b>te</b> as it is just as often
spelled.) And this, so far, agrees with the title of the Pimo infant, whose name
is frequently said to be <b>Mu-ti</b> (zuma.)</p>

<p>A <b>Mu-ti</b>, say the Chinese.</p>

<p>A <b>Mu-ti</b>, say the Pimos.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the Chinese record, the imperial (<b>ti</b> or <b>te</b>) heir apparent (or
<b>yuen-tsz</b>) suckling or baby (<b>ju</b>) whose estate or patrimony (<b>chan</b>) was
<b>Loh-ming</b> (name of a region) lived or resided (<b>ku</b>) as the tender, delicate
youth (<b>yao</b>) <b>Mu</b>.</p>

<p>Here we see that the heir apparent the ju or baby was both <b>Mu</b> and a <b>ti</b>.
The old account connects the infantile ruler with a region called Loh-ming.
We need not delay to ascertain the position of this province or land; enough
now to observe that wherever it was, the <b>ju</b> and <b>ti</b> lived there (or lived some
where) as the pleasing and tender <b>Mu</b>.</p>

<p>The baby was <b>Mu</b>.</p>

<p>This name, like some of our own names, such as Grace, Patience, Clement,
is frequently used as an adjective. It may stand for either "beauty" or
"majesty," but it is also, at times, a surname. (note 77.)<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>As already seen, the Great Canyon with the connected bottomless abyss, in
the region beyond the Eastern Sea, is connected with the Sun and Moon Shan.
And on this Shan is "the Great Men's Country" (see existing translation.)
Now a Chinese comment (note 78) informs us that the <b>forts</b> of the entirely
great <b>Mu</b> formerly held or possessed this Great Men's Country (which is on
the Sun and Moon Shan.)</p>

<p>Information is next furnished concerning the largest Walrusses, and it is
plain that the polar region is referred to. The account is quite clear, as any
Chinese scholar can see, now that we have pointed out the position of the
passage.</p>

<p>It might seem advisable to prove that the haunt of the Walrus was known
to the ancient Chinese writers who have furnished accounts of America, but it
is unnecessary to do this, seeing that the phenomenon of Ten Suns, which is
only visible at the Arctic Circle, is referred to in the ancient books. Moreover,
as we have learned, appearances of five or seven suns (or moons) shining
simultaneously in the sky, are distinctly connected with the Sun and Moon Shan.
It was therefore known that the mountain system of North America, stretches
upward&mdash;like the Branches of a Tree&mdash;from the vicinity of the Grand Canyon
to the Polar region, or place of the Ten Suns. And from a point here, the
shores of North-eastern Tartary or Asia can be seen without even the aid of an
opera-glass.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It now appears that in the remote past there was a ruler named <b>Mu</b> dwelling
in the mountainous land which stretches from the Grand Canyon to the
Arctic Ocean. His domain was on the Sun and Moon Shan.</p>

<p>And he had fortified dwellings or forts.</p>

<p>Where, today, are the remains of the ancient strongholds?</p>

<p>One observer says with reference to the cliff-dwellings, that they "have
the appearance of fortified retreats. The occupants, on account of "decending
hordes devised these <b>unassailable</b> retreats.... The builders hold no smallest
niche in recorded history. Their aspirations, their struggles and their fate
are all unwritten, save in these crumbling stones, which are their sole monuments
and meagre epitaph. Here once they dwelt. They left no other print
on time." (note 79.)</p>

<p>The "unassailable retreats" noticed by this melancholy writer may well
be some of the strongholds of Mu and his followers or warriors. The ancient
pueblos (or Casas Grandes) are of great strength. When the "ladders are
drawn in, the various sides present a perpendicular front to an enemy, and the
building itself becomes a <b>fortress</b>." Further, "The strength of the walls of
these structures was proved during the Mexican war, when it was found that
they were impregnable to field-artillery." (note 80.)</p>

<p>The Spanish soldier, Castenada, in the 16th century said with regard to the
Pimo Casa Grande, that "it seemed to have served as a fortress." (note 81.)</p>

<p>Now, <b>Pimo</b>&mdash;represented by the symbols for a maternal case and hill&mdash;is
mentioned on the very page of the Chinese book which notices our Grand
Canyon. Then, we are told that cliff-dwellings were here and a Sun Prince<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 35]</span>
(at first a mere <b>ju</b> or infant) called <b>Mu</b>, and that he or his followers erected
forts or fortresses.</p>

<p>And here we find no scarcity of ancient strongholds.</p>

<p>And when we ask the Indians for the name of the ruler who governed the
now decaying strongholds, their answer is&mdash;<b>Mu</b>.</p>

<p>The very title in the Chinese book.</p>

<p><b>Mu</b>, say the Ancients.</p>

<p><b>Mu</b>, say our Indians.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It may be said that some of the latter pronounce the title <b>Mo</b>. One of our
philologists speaks of "Montezuma, or more correctly, <b>Mo</b>tecuhzoma."
(note 82.)</p>

<p>Another authority says: "Montezuma, or more correctly, <b>Moc</b>tezuma."
(note 83.)</p>

<p>In his account of the Casa Grande, the old time Spanish traveler, Padre
Garces, says: On this river is situated the house which they call <b>Moc</b>tezuma's.
(note 84.)</p>

<p>It is evident that the two pronunciations <b>Mo</b> and <b>Mok</b> are preferred to
<b>Mon</b> (tezuma) and that <b>Mu</b> has also its advocates.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Curiously enough, these three sounds <b>Mu</b>, <b>Mo</b>, and <b>Mok</b>, are likewise
applied to the one character by the Chinese literati.</p>

<p>The identical symbol which Williams calls <b>Mu</b> is in another dictionary
(see Bailley's, iii, p. 246) termed <b>Mo</b>.</p>

<p>Morrison (vol. IV, p. 600-1) says that the two sounds <b>Mu</b> and <b>Mo</b> are both
applied, and that in Canton this selfsame character is called <b>Mok</b>.</p>

<p>It thus appears that the builder or ruler of the fortresses in the region
beyond the Eastern Sea, might be called <b>Mu</b>, <b>Mo</b>, or <b>Mok</b>.</p>

<p>And in the region referred to&mdash;"the region beyond the Eastern Sea"&mdash;we
find many strongholds or forts (as well as cave-dwellings;) and when antiquarians
inquire of the Indians for the name of the ancient Builder Prince, they
are variously informed that he was the glorious <b>Mu</b>, <b>Mo</b>, or <b>Mok</b>.</p>

<p>If the royal infant (or <b>ju</b>) became in process of time a ruler of fortresses
(<b>tai</b>) which "formerly held the Great Men's Country" (on the Sun and Moon
Shan) would be surprising to find that he himself had been born within the
shelter of a <b>tai</b> or fortress? And what is the fortified hill at Pimo but a
fortress? He counts it as the first of the forts of <b>Mu</b> or <b>Mo-ti</b> in "the region
beyond the Eastern Sea."</p>

<p>Remember that our own government has erected numbers of forts on hilltops
throughout the South-west expressly for the purpose of holding such tribes
as the Navajoes and Apaches in check. (And in addition we are furnishing
the red men with supplies.) But in the 11th century there were no Congressional
appropriations, no detachments of troops hurrying down from Washington
to preserve order. Yet the ancestors of our savage tribes were certainly there.
And although the warrior chieftans immediately around the young queen
appear to have been filled with jealousy of each other, it is certain that they<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 36]</span>
were united as one in devising for the princess a calm or sure retreat which no
barbaric host could take by assault. From its base the savage ranks would
reel, or break into foam like waves of the sea.</p>

<p>Aloft in this secure retreat she gave birth to <b>Mo</b>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Who was his father?</p>

<p>The American General already referred to, supplies his own report of the
Pimo interpreter's words:</p>

<p>"All he knew was a tradition amongst them, 'that in bygone days, a woman
of surpassing beauty resided in a green spot in the mountains near the place
where we were encamped. All the men admired and paid court to her. She
received the tributes of their devotion, grain, skins, etc., but gave no love or
other favor in return. Her virtue and her determination to remain unmarried
were equally firm. There came a drought which threatened the world with
famine. In their distress, people applied to her, and she gave corn from her
stock, and the supply seemed to be endless. Her goodness was unbounded.
One day, as she was lying asleep with her body exposed, a drop of rain fell on
her stomach, which produced conception. A son was the issue, the founder
of a new race which built all these houses'.... The houses of the people
(the agricultural or sedentary Pimos) are mere sheds, thatched with willow
and corn stalks" (n. 85.)</p>

<p>This report is more rational than the other in so far as it represents the
multitudinous houses of stone or adobe as being reared by a "race" rather than
by a "boy"! But, of course, the "son" could not have been the "founder" of
his mother or of her ancestors. It is further apparent that the infant could not
have been either the builder or inventor of the house or stronghold in which
he was born.</p>

<p>Of course it is an impossibility to get at the exact truth in relation to the
mysterious birth. The unwedded lady's own account ought to constitute a
sufficient explanation, and would&mdash;but for the unfortunate historic fact that no
mother has ever been known to tell her children the truth about their production.
Even Christian mothers lie precisely like Pagans in this respect, and are
just as thorough-going humbugs as Hannah in the temple, when questioned for
details. They will tell a poor helpless, green, inquiring child, for instance, that
they found him in a cabbage, when the actual truth is that they got him from a
stork. We therefore unanimously dismiss their worse than useless testimony
as that of a shameless pack of preposterous deluderers.</p>

<p>It is probable that the Pimo princess may have been secretly wedded or
united to some man whom she really loved and preferred to all others. Yet
an open avowal of such preference might have caused his death or might have
turned the love of rival suitors into hate and brought about the ruin of the
already sufficiently perplexed and troubled nation.</p>

<p>But would not the birth of the infant have revealed all?</p>

<p>Certainly, but in the present instance the Queen seems to have contented
herself with the announcement that she had got her child from Heaven. Her
friends, including doubtless the priests, at once spread abroad the story that the
infant&mdash;the Child of the Sun&mdash;was of celestial origin. This tale may not have<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 37]</span>
completely satisfied the numerous rival claimants for the lady's hand. But how
disprove it? And why assail or shake the authority of the beautiful young
queen? Why not draw closer together, bury their mutual animosities or rivalries
and face the murderous hordes thronging the passes of the Rocky Mountains
and slopes of the Mississippi Valley? Why not grasp at the hope&mdash;embodied
in the suckling born on the hilltop&mdash;that Heaven had furnished a leader, a reincarnated
divinity of the wandering nation, who would guide the despairing
people onward to new fields of national glory and prosperity.</p>

<p>It may of course be said that such predictions were never realized, but it
is certain that they were cherished. Even the Mokis, Tunis and Pimos still
regard <b>Mo-ti</b> as immortal and await his return. He is "the demigod of their
earliest traditions, watching over them from Heaven and waiting to come again
to bring to them victory and a period of millenial glory and happiness" (n. 86.)
And, of course, those who actually followed the leader <b>Mu</b> must have felt
strongly the ties of affection and veneration. And who were the people who
got across to Mongolia with accounts of our Grand Canyon, Gulf and Continental
Tree&mdash;crowned with its wreath of multiplied suns?</p>

<p>[Doubtless the notion that our <b>Mu-te</b> (or <b>Te-Mu</b>) was of divine origin,
had a surprising, stimulating effect. Curiously enough, Asiatic writers notice a
<b>Te-mu</b> (<b>Te-mu-dzin</b> or <b>Temugin</b>) who arose in Tartary in the early part of
the 12th century, and therefore might be regarded as the contemporary of our
<b>Mu</b> born at Pimo about the year 1100. Some say this Tartarean conqueror
was called Timour or Temur-chi, and his origin is wrapt in mystery. One
account treats him as a demigod, but other statements assume that a divinity
was his remote ancestor. He is said to belong to the race that broke out of
Irkena Kon (or the mountain valley), situated in some out of the way and
dangerous region. Personally this <b>Mu</b> came from a distant land. Some historians
whose time is valuable readily find Irkena Kon in the vicinity of the
Caspian Sea, but others declare that it must be situated in the direction of the
Arctic Ocean!</p>

<p>[In his old age, in or about the year 1153, this supposed demigod had a
child born to him. The name of Temudzin or Temugin was bestowed upon
the infant. When thirteen years old his father&mdash;the demigod&mdash;died, and the
extensive empire which the parent had established fell into political pieces.
Gibbon, in his "Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire," chap. LXIV, says that
the young prince Temugin could only claim authority over about 12,000 families.
We should never overlook this fact when contemplating his career.
Every incident in his history is known. His name has resounded through the
world. He rose to be a mighty conqueror. He became Jenghiz Khan&mdash;King
of Kings&mdash;grandsire of Kublai Khan, ancestor of Tamerlane and the Great
Moguls, and of no end of Persian or Moslem Sultans or Kings.</p>

<p>[The immediate followers of Jenghiz Khan always declared that success
awaited him because he was the son of a God. Petis de la Croix denounces
such a claim as a piece of "insolence," yet it might better be regarded as a
form of delusion. But notice the victorious lengths to which this delusion
carried believers. And the notion promulgated at Pimo, in the midst of crowd<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 38]</span>ing
calamities,&mdash;that the royal infant was a Son of Heaven,&mdash;might have been
intended to console and stimulate a despairing nation. And the spiritual stimulus
appears to have transported its believers to such lengths that aboriginal
Americans seem to have lost track of the demigod, and know not from what
point he may return.</p>

<p>[The father of Temugin was the founder of the <b>Yuen</b> dynasty, or at all
events an ancestral king. He is generally called Yisukai or Pysukai Behadur,
but such is a mere title, signifying "9th hero," and not a proper name at all.
Some lucid commentators will positively tell us that it was not the father
of Jenghiz Khan, but his 9th father or ancestor, who was the God. But with
such hair-splitting we need not concern ourselves. Enough to note the uplifting,
psychological effect or result of faith or belief in divine aid or protection.
No wonder David exclaims: "Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me."</p>

<p>[In the case of the Tartars, the results of their exalted faith were indeed surprising.
The Crusades of the Christians had proved a failure. Jerusalem had
passed from their hands. Richard, King of England, had been taken prisoner.
The Moslems, according to Gibbon, were preparing for the invasion of Europe.
Their brethren were actually intrenched in the heart of Spain. Enraged against
western nations for the long war waged against their power, armies were
gathering for the conquest and plunder of Christendom. The crescent instead
of the cross, says Gibbon, was to glitter on the spire of St. Paul's.</p>

<p>[But at this very juncture, Jenghiz Khan and his followers came pouring
forth from the wilds of Tartary. The Sultan felt secure within his line of fortified
cities which hitherto had repelled every assault. But the Tartarean host&mdash;led
by warriors of the race from Irkena Kon&mdash;overthrew the Moslems in every
encounter. They ransacked the provinces and gave the cities to the flames.
And the children or successors of the conqueror completed the work which he
had begun. Bagdad which for ages had successfully defied the invading,
crusading armies of Europe, was destroyed, and an end put to the Caliphate so
long enthroned within its historic walls. The conquest of China was completed
by Kublai Khan, and an empire formed which stretched from the Indian Ocean
to the Arctic, and from the Pacific to the Mediterranean Sea.]</p>

<p>Even traditions of tribes that most certainly remained behind in Arizona
and consequently did not disappear in company with the mysterious <b>Mu</b> or
Mo-te, declare that he was an agent of Providence. He was the "equal" of
the "Great Spirit" and "was often considered identical with the Sun" (n. 87.)
Had he remained in Arizona, his son in due time might have claimed divine
descent through his father the demigod.</p>


<h2>CHINESE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PIMO DEMIGOD.</h2>

<p>But if the <b>Mu-te</b> (or <b>Te-Mu</b>,) builder or ruler of fortresses in the region of
Pimo and the Grand Canyon, was identical with our Pimo <b>Mu-te</b>, he should be
referred to as semi-divine, in the Chinese record.</p>

<p>And so he actually is. Even here the evidence does not fail. But conception
of the little sun-child did not occur on the well watched or guarded<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 39]</span>
hilltop at Pimo. It was in a green wilderness noted for its hay or grass and
butchering of beasts, that a phantasm approached the female&mdash;and so on.</p>

<p>Fortunately we can turn away from this particular account of the visit of
incubus, seeing that the necessary information is more conveniently furnished
elsewhere (n. 88.) The name of a mountain, which may or may not have been
far indeed from the Grand Canyon, is furnished, and we are informed that
<b>Shao Hao</b> dwelt (<b>ku</b>) there (<b>chi</b>.) In addition he is called a sovereign (<b>ti</b> or <b>te</b>)
and a <b>shan</b>.</p>

<p>Now this term, <b>shan</b>, according to Williams (p. 737,) stands for "the gods,
the divinities, a god, a supernatural good being; divine; spiritual, as being
higher than man; godlike, wonderful, superhuman; to deify.</p>

<p>The <b>Shao Hao</b> (or <b>Mu-ti</b>) is a <b>shan</b> or god.</p>

<p>A god! say the Chinese.</p>

<p>A god! say the Indians.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Taking the account as it stands, it appears that an incarnated god (in the
shape of the <b>Shao Hao Mu</b>) was at one time within the Grand Canyon (which
still retains his "lute.")</p>

<p>Notice that the "country contiguous to the mighty chasm is called the
"Shao Hao's country."</p>

<p>Next observe that the vast chasm (or <b>ta-hoh</b>) is itself called the Great
Canyon of the Incarnated God (or <b>Keang Shang</b>.) <b>Shang</b> stands for "Heaven"
or supreme;" and Keang signifies "to descend from a higher level, to come from
the sky, to fall as rain, to come into the world as Christ did" (Williams.) The
contiguous country is named in honor of the <b>Shao Hao</b>, or sun-child, who is
called a <b>shan</b> or god. And "<b>Keang Shang's</b> ta-hoh" or great Canyon is also
named in honor of this <b>shan</b> or god&mdash;this incarnated god.</p>

<p>And here, "in the region beyond the Eastern Sea," the land is ringing with
his name. He was <b>Mu</b> or <b>Mo-te</b> and a builder of forts, and above and beyond
all this he was an incarnation of the Great Spirit!</p>

<p>"The name, at this moment, is as familiar to every Indian, Apache and
Navajoe as that of our Savior or Washington is to us" (n. 89.)</p>

<p>Bancroft says: "Under restrictions, we may fairly regard him as the Melchizedek,
the <b>Moses</b>, and the Messiah of the Pueblo desert-wanderers from an
Egypt that history is ignorant of, and whose name even tradition whispers not."</p>

<p>A Messiah and Demigod! say the Chinese.</p>

<p>A Messiah and Demigod! say Americans.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bancroft, says, that according to Indian paintings or traditions, the Messiah
or Demigod of Pueblo tradition had red or yellow hair.</p>

<p>Then Mo was a white man and his mother a white woman.</p>

<p>Such a conclusion agrees completely with the teaching of the ancient Chinese
book just quoted. We are informed with reference to a certain mountain,
that: <b>Ki</b> (the) <b>shan</b> (god or spirit) <b>poh</b> (white) <b>ti</b> (sovereign) <b>Shao hao</b> (little
sun-child) <b>ku</b> (dwelt) <b>chi</b> (there).</p>

<p>Next appears a comment stating in the plainest possible terms that <b>Shao
Hao</b> of the <b>Kin Tien</b> dynasty was a virtuous or excellent ruler.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>The <b>Shao Hao</b> who was at the Ta-hoh or Great Canyon is here called a
<b>White King</b>.</p>

<p>Mons. Rosny, in his French translation, declares that the divine or superhuman
<b>Shao Hao</b> was "l'empereur Blanc." (note 90.)</p>

<p>One well known writer and archaeologist says with reference to the builders
of some structures in the Pimo region, that there is "reason to suppose that
they were a light-skinned people. At least one red-haired skull and one with
still lighter hair were found. Hair has been but rarely found not over a half
dozen times in all. In three cases it was black." (note 91.)</p>

<p>According to aboriginal testimony, 800 years have rolled by since the time
of burial, and hair has lingered on but few of the heads it once adorned. But
when discovered it is seen to be quite different from the hair of the Indians.</p>

<p>Those interested in the subject of the Cliff-dwellers should study the
accurate reports of the Ethnological Bureau and also the writings of Editor
Peet the well known "American Antiquarian." These works should be in the
libraries of all Americanists.</p>

<p>According to the American Antiquarian, Doctor Birdsall reports that dried
bodies have been found in tombs on the Mesa Verde in Arizona and the "hair
of the head has been found partly preserved on some mummies. It is said to
be of fine texture, not coarse like Indian hair and varying in color from shades
of yellowish brown to reddish brown and black" ... The Wetherills exhumed
one mummy having a short brownish beard." (note 92.)</p>

<p>We are further informed that mummies have been taken from "a hermetically
sealed cave in the Canyon of the Gila River," and two of the bodies were
those of women. The females "retain their long, flowing silken hair." The
"bodies were covered with highly colored clothes, which crumbled on exposure.
Three kinds were saved, and one a deep blue woven in diamond
shapes. No implements or utensils were found.... All the consuls and many
scientific men inspected the mummies yesterday. Among those present were
Henry A. Ward, of Rochester, N. Y., Kate Field, Dr. Harkness, Academy of
Sciences." Other Doctors and Professors were present and also "Historian
Bancroft." (n. 93.)</p>

<p>In addition to all this, Professor C. L. Webster, the accomplished, painstaking,
and trusted scientist of Charles City, Iowa, has unearthed a body whose
silent testimony is truly inestimable. In the "Archaeological Bulletin," issued
by the International Society of Archaeologists (Madison, Indiana,) for July and
September, 1912, we find a photograph of a mummy brought to light by the
Professor in a cliff-house on a head stream of the Gila.</p>

<p>The body is that of a child, and its preservation is due to "the chemical
elements of the soil," etc.</p>

<p>"The hair on the head of the mummy was of a beautiful dark brown color,
and of a soft and silky texture," and "the hair on the head of this mummified
child is of the same color and texture (only finer) as that of adults found braided
in long plaits in an adjoining room"&mdash;Page 78.</p>

<p>The Professor believes that "different races" were here contending for the
mastery of the region, and that "one or more of them were driven out (perhaps
destroyed) suddenly" (see article 1.)<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 41]</span></p>

<p>Another archaeologist says, that "quite recently hieroglyphics were discovered
in the Tonto Basin country, depicting the driving out of white people
by red men, and local archaeologists have set up a theory that the people who
once cultivated these valleys were white. The present Indians have many
legends of white men being in their country before the advent of the Spanish
conquistodores. Father Marcas Niza, a pious Jesuit, who accompanied Coronado
on his march through this section in search of the seven lost cities of Cibola,
speaks frequently of allusions made by Indians to white bearded men who
were here before" (n. 94.)</p>

<p>[In tracking the missing white race, remember that some of the Toltecs,
like the Mayas of Yucatan, compressed the skull in childhood, that they had
among them a sprinkling of very large men (quinames,) and that in the wilderness
their mode of living would be more like that of Indians than of cultured,
civilized people.]</p>

<p>Mons. Charney has argued that the Mexican Toltecs were of a white race,
but very foolishly argues (like Baron Humboldt) that the Toltecs marched from
Mongolia to Mexico in the 6th century. The illustrious Humboldt has served
Archaeology enormously by drawing attention to the absolute and startling
identity of the Zodiacal signs of the Manchu Tartars with those of Central
America (see Mr. Vining's exceedingly comprehensive and valuable work entitled
"An Inglorious Columbus.")</p>

<p>Skilled, scientific archaeologists connected with the Washington Bureau
have all along been contending that the cliff or cave dwellings, forts, pueblos,
and mounds of North America were constructed by native-born Americans,
rather than by Toltecs moving in, say, the 6th century from Tartary to Arizona
or Mexico.</p>

<p>Therefore, as the Toltecs (sun-people and architects or builders) were
certainly settled in Mexico for some centuries prior to the 11th (when the remnant
disappeared,) the ancestors of the pale-faced and cultured people (see
Vining's chapter on the "Toltecs") may like ourselves have reached America
by crossing the Atlantic. The Greek face, the Celtic face, the Saxon face, and
the Jewish or Semitic face are all seen carved on the tottering walls of temples
and palaces in Yucatan (see Charney's essays.)</p>

<p>Moving to the Vale of Mexico, the Toltecs tried with more or less success
to keep on neighborly terms with the red skinned people. But thoughtless
propagation produced more mouths than could be filled&mdash;except with human
flesh. Open war broke out in the 11th century. The Aztecs or others of the
red tribes almost annihilated the Whites; and Topiltzin Quetzalcoatl, the "last"
King of the Toltecs fled north from Chapultepec,&mdash;the selfsame Chapultepec
which in our own day has seen the downfall of Maxmillian and the flight
of Diaz.</p>

<p>May not the fair and beautiful Princess at Pimo have belonged to the outcast
Mexican royal family? May not her idolized child have inherited titles
absurdly out of place among the deserts of Arizona? And may not all the
elements in our later Yankee nation have been represented in the pale-faced
people that found refuge among the canyons and cliffs of the Colorado? If so,
their remote or ancestral fathers and mothers were likewise no less our own.<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 42]</span></p>

<p>The curtain of history rises and shows the young Queen of the Builders on
a hill top at Pimo. The structures there, according to aboriginal testimony
were reared about the year 1100,&mdash;the very time when the Toltecs disappeared
from the Vale of Mexico. And now the ruins are yielding up forms of the females
who once tenanted those cliffs and contrived to get plaster and paint with
which to adorn the now desolate and trembling walls. And the yellow, brown,
or silky black hair on the heads of those women who sought to make their
bleak and dreary homes attractive, shows unfailingly their race. Even an
ostrich might see it!</p>

<p>Mons. Charney declares that the Toltecs expelled from Mexico in the 11th
century were scholars, artists, astronomers, and philosophers. And their sisters
were certainly no less cultured and refined.</p>

<p>Now, the Shan Hai King states that in "the region beyond the Eastern Sea"
there is (or was) a "Country of Refined Gentlemen."</p>

<p>And Charney argues that "a gentle race were the Toltecs, preferring the
arts to war."</p>

<p>Refined and Gentle&mdash;men, says Charney.</p>

<p>Refined Gentlemen, says the Shan Hai King.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Certain comments collected by Jin Chin Ngan, and unnoticed in Mr. Vining's
translation (p. 657), connect the Refined Gentlemen with pyramids (<b>k'iu</b>)
and even declare that their dwellings were on mounds (<b>ling</b>).</p>

<p>And Charney says: "Now, the first thing that we find at the houses of Tula
is an example of a mode of building entirely new and curious. The prevailing
tendency of the Toltec is to place his dwellings and his temples likewise upon
eminences and pyramids."</p>

<p>They lived upon Mounds, says Charney.</p>

<p>They lived upon Mounds, says the Shan Hai King.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"They are very gentle, and do not quarrel. They have fragrant plants.
They have a flowering-plant which produces blossoms in the morning that die
in the evening.</p>

<p>The Chinese account calls this vegetable production the <b>Hwa</b> plant, and as
<b>Hwa</b> stands for "glory" (see Williams' Chinese dict.) it is apparent that the
"Morning Glory" is referred to.</p>

<p>Botanist Wood says: "This <b>glorious</b> plant is a <b>native</b> of Tropical America
and now universally cultivated. It is also nearly naturalized with us." (in the
United States.)</p>

<p>"The flowers are ephemeral. Beginning to open soon after midnight, they
greet the Sun at his rising, arrayed in all their <b>glory</b>" (<b>Hwa</b>) "and before he
reaches the meridian, fold their robes and perish. But their work is done, and
their successors, already in bud, will renew the gorgeous display the following
morning."&mdash;P. 182.</p>

<p>Such a flower might be held to symbolize the fleeting glory of the generations
which had lived and died in Central America. It still climbs about the
temples of the Sun, saluting its divinity with a smile, and then falling prostrate
among the desolate and forsaken altars. It may often be seen twining its arms<span class='pagenum'>[Pg 43]</span>
around the monuments of a buried Past, or pressing its lips to the dust of the
vanished race it so speedily follows.</p>

<p>It lives but a day, says the American botanist.</p>

<p>It lives but a day, says the Shan Hai King.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Surely the works in Arizona are worthy of the exiled Toltecs.</p>

<p>One of the ancient stone structures, on a northern feeder of the Gila, is so
strong, commodious, and so impregnably planted that by universal consent it is
called a Castle. And because the Indian tribes persist in ascribing its construction
to <b>Mu</b> or <b>Mo-te</b> it is known as "Montezuma's Castle." The Ethnological
Bureau has interested itself in the preservation of this impressive work of the
so-called Cliff-dwellers, and our Government has taken charge of it as a
"National Monument." And <b>Ari-zona</b> is named in honor of the <b>Ari</b> or "Maiden"&mdash;the
legendary Queen of the Pimo <b>zona</b> or Pimo valley. The mother referred
to in the ancient Chinese record is thus remembered in the title of a Yankee
sister State.</p>

<p>Her idolized son is said to have governed Forts, and in the vicinity of the
Castle we find a number of forts. Dr. Fewkes says: "The <b>forts</b> were built on
the summits, ... and it is an instructive fact in this connection that one rarely
loses sight of one of these hill <b>forts</b> before another can be <b>seen</b>." An
"approaching foe" could be discerned and "smoke signals" would warn field-workers
"to retreat to the <b>forts</b> for protection."&mdash;28th Rept. Bur. Amer. Ethnol.,
p. 207. (Read also connected pages for information relating to the forts
and their builders. The same or an allied people erected also houses in natural
caves or excavated them in soft rock."&mdash;P. 219. The latter&mdash;the excavated
dwellings are noticed in Asiatic books and will be dealt with in next pamphlet&mdash;if
such is ever written.)</p>

<p>We have found the "Forts" and also Pimo (or Pima as some pronounce
the name) with its Princess and her child. And have we not found the Gulf
and Canyon referred to by the departed Ancients. Have we not found everything
except perhaps the abandoned imperial Lute? And even it may yet be
recovered. Let it be dug for at the Cliff of the Harp. Perhaps it may yet be
resurrected&mdash;</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
